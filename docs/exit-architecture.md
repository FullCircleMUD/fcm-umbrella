# Exit Architecture

> Technical design document for the exit system. For world building and zone design, see [world.md](world.md). For procedural dungeon design, see [procedural-dungeons.md](procedural-dungeons.md). For cartography and mapping, see [cartography.md](cartography.md).

## Design Philosophy

Exits are the connective tissue of the game world. A player's experience of moving through the world should be seamless and consistent — whether they're walking down a road, opening a locked door, diving underwater, or stepping into a procedural dungeon that didn't exist until they entered it.

All exits share a common foundation. Specialised behaviors (doors, dungeon entry, conditional routing) are composed from reusable building blocks — mixins and base classes — rather than built as parallel systems. A door that leads to a dungeon should behave like a door AND a dungeon entry, not one or the other.

## Class Hierarchy

```

└── ExitBase
    └── ExitVerticalAware
        ├── ExitDoor (+ SmashableMixin, LockableMixin, CloseableMixin,
        │   │           InvisibleObjectMixin, HiddenObjectMixin)
        │   └── TrapDoor (+ TrapMixin — directional door trap)
        ├── TripwireExit (+ TrapMixin — directional passage trap)
        ├── DungeonExit (lazy room creation inside procedural dungeons)
        ├── DungeonPassageExit (dungeon → world exit, cleans up instance tags)
        ├── ConditionalRoutingExit (routes between rooms based on conditions)
        ├── ProceduralDungeonExit (+ ProceduralDungeonMixin — simple dungeon entry)
        ├── ConditionalDungeonExit (+ ProceduralDungeonMixin — quest-gated dungeon)
        ├── ExitTutorialStart (spawns a TutorialInstanceScript on traverse)
        └── ExitTutorialReturn (cleans up tutorial state, returns player to prior location)
```

### Composable Pieces

The exit system uses composition over inheritance for specialised behaviors:

```
ProceduralDungeonMixin          — provides enter_dungeon() capability (any exit)
ConditionalRoutingExit          — routes between rooms based on conditions
ProceduralDungeonExit           — ProceduralDungeonMixin + ExitVerticalAware
ConditionalDungeonExit          — ProceduralDungeonMixin + ConditionalRoutingExit
DungeonDoor                     — ProceduralDungeonMixin + ExitDoor (future)
```

See [procedural-dungeons.md](procedural-dungeons.md) for the full dungeon entry architecture.

## Base Classes

### ExitBase

**File:** `typeclasses/terrain/exits/exit_base.py`
**Inherits:** `DefaultExit`

The foundation for all game exits. Provides a single enhancement over Evennia's default: auto-generates a preview description from the destination room when no custom `db.desc` is set. This prevents the generic "This is an exit." from ever showing to players.

**When to use:** Never directly. Always use `ExitVerticalAware` or a more specific subclass.

### ExitVerticalAware

**File:** `typeclasses/terrain/exits/exit_vertical_aware.py`
**Inherits:** `ExitBase`

The standard exit for the game world. Provides two systems:

**Direction system:**
- `direction` AttributeProperty stores the compass direction (north, south, up, down, etc.)
- `set_direction()` sets the direction and auto-adds abbreviation aliases (n, s, u, d, etc.)
- `get_display_name()` formats as "direction: description" for the verbose `exits` command
- The room's `get_display_exits()` reads the `direction` attribute to show compact `[ Exits: n s e w ]`

**Vertical traversal checks:**
- Encumbrance: blocks flying/swimming while overloaded (falling, sinking)
- Height: blocks movement if character is too high for destination room
- Depth: blocks movement if character is too deep for destination room
- All checks run before `super().at_traverse()` — failed checks cancel movement silently

**Size gating:**
- `max_size` AttributeProperty — largest actor size that can pass. Defaults to `Size.GARGANTUAN.value` (unrestricted). Set to a smaller `Size.X.value` to restrict passage (e.g. `Size.TINY.value` for a mousehole, `Size.SMALL.value` for a halfling tunnel).
- Checked in `at_traverse()` after height gating: `size_value(actor.size) > size_value(self.max_size)` → "You are too large to fit through there."
- **Unlike height-gated exits, size-gated exits remain visible** in the exit list — the player should see the passage exists so they know a shrink spell is needed.
- Door helpers default `max_size` to `Size.MEDIUM.value` (standard human-sized door). Stable doors, castle gates, etc. override to `Size.LARGE.value` or higher.

**When to use:** Most world exits. Authored as a YAML `exits:` entry; the Loader materialises it via `connect_bidirectional_exit()` internally.

### ExitDoor

**File:** `typeclasses/terrain/exits/exit_door.py`
**Inherits:** `SmashableMixin, LockableMixin, CloseableMixin, InvisibleObjectMixin, HiddenObjectMixin, ExitVerticalAware`

A door that can be opened, closed, locked, unlocked, hidden, made invisible, and smashed. Doors are always created in pairs (one per side) linked via `link_door_pair()`.

**MRO rule:** SmashableMixin must come first, LockableMixin before CloseableMixin, so the `can_open()` lock check fires via the super() chain.

**Key behaviors:**
- Closed doors are hidden from the `[ Exits: ]` auto-exit line
- Closed doors are visible via the `exits` command with state indicators
- Locked doors block both opening and traversal
- Hidden doors (`is_hidden=True`) are invisible until discovered via `search`
- Invisible doors require `DETECT_INVIS` condition to see
- Reciprocal pairing syncs state changes between both sides
- `door_name` attribute controls what `open door` matches — use distinct names when multiple doors exist in one room (e.g. "door" vs "stone door")
- **Auto-close:** all doors auto-close after 5 minutes by default (`auto_close_seconds = 300`). Set to `0` to disable, or any other value for custom timing (e.g. `30` for a spring-loaded door). The timer starts when the door is opened and is cancelled if the door is manually closed. The auto-close fires `at_close()` so reciprocal pairing syncs the other side automatically.

**When to use:** Any door connection. Authored as a paired YAML `exits:` entry (with `links:` for reciprocal `other_side`); the Loader materialises the pair via `connect_bidirectional_door_exit()` internally.

## Conditional Routing

**File:** `typeclasses/terrain/exits/conditional_routing_exit.py`
**Inherits:** `ExitVerticalAware`

An exit that routes between two destinations based on player state. The exit is always visible; the destination changes. Inherits the full direction system and vertical checks from `ExitVerticalAware`.

**Attributes:**
- `condition_type` — `"quest_active"`, `"quest_complete"`, or `"has_tag"`
- `condition_key` — the quest key, tag name, etc.
- `alternate_destination_id` — room ID for the alternate destination

**Routing logic:**
- Condition met → traverse to `destination` (the exit's normal destination)
- Condition NOT met → traverse to `alternate_destination_id`
- No condition configured → always primary destination
- No alternate set and condition not met → "The way is blocked."

Both paths use `super().at_traverse()` so vertical checks, encumbrance, and height restrictions all apply regardless of which destination is chosen.

**Condition types:**

| Type | Checks | True when |
|---|---|---|
| `quest_active` | `quests.has(key) and not quests.is_completed(key)` | Quest accepted but not finished |
| `quest_complete` | `quests.is_completed(key)` | Quest finished |
| `has_tag` | `tags.get(key, category="player_flag")` | Player has the flag tag |

This class has zero dungeon knowledge. It's a pure routing mechanism usable for any condition-based exit (quest gates, alignment locks, level restrictions, etc.).

## Dungeon Exits

### ProceduralDungeonMixin

**File:** `typeclasses/mixins/procedural_dungeon.py`

A mixin that adds dungeon instance creation capability to any exit. Provides `enter_dungeon(traversing_object)` as a utility method — does NOT override `at_traverse`. The host class decides when to call it.

**Attributes:**
- `dungeon_template_id` — template to instantiate
- `dungeon_destination_room_id` — for passage dungeons, the destination world room

**Key method — `enter_dungeon(traversing_object)`:**
1. Template lookup + validation
2. Dungeon tag check (prevent stacking)
3. Character collection (group/solo/shared mode)
4. Instance resolution (find existing shared or create new)
5. Start dungeon or join existing shared instance
6. Entry announcement
7. Returns True/False

### ProceduralDungeonExit

**File:** `typeclasses/terrain/exits/procedural_dungeon_exit.py`
**Inherits:** `ProceduralDungeonMixin, ExitVerticalAware`

Simple dungeon entry — always enters a procedural dungeon on traversal. `at_traverse` calls `self.enter_dungeon()` directly. Does not call `super()` since dungeon entry handles its own movement.

**Use for:** Unconditional dungeon entries (deep woods passages, cave of trials).

### ConditionalDungeonExit

**File:** `typeclasses/terrain/exits/conditional_dungeon_exit.py`
**Inherits:** `ProceduralDungeonMixin, ConditionalRoutingExit`

Quest-gated dungeon entry with fallback room. Condition met → `enter_dungeon()`. Condition not met → normal traversal to alternate destination (with full vertical checks).

**Use for:** Quest-gated dungeons where non-quest players should reach a different room (e.g. rat cellar: quest active → dungeon instance, no quest → empty cellar).

## Tutorial Hub Exits

Two specialised exits drive the Tutorial Hub. Both inherit from `ExitVerticalAware`.

### ExitTutorialStart

**File:** `typeclasses/terrain/exits/exit_tutorial_hub.py`

Per-chunk tutorial entry exit. Each instance carries a `tutorial_num` attribute (1, 2, or 3) selecting which tutorial chunk to launch. On traverse:

1. Validates `tutorial_num` is in (1, 2, 3)
2. Refuses entry if the player already has a `tutorial_character` tag
3. Creates a fresh `TutorialInstanceScript`, wires it to the hub, and calls `start_tutorial(player, chunk_num)`

The script is responsible for moving the player into the tutorial — `at_traverse` does not call `super()`.

### ExitTutorialReturn

**File:** `typeclasses/terrain/exits/exit_tutorial_hub.py`

South exit from the Tutorial Hub. Returns the player to their pre-tutorial location, or The Harvest Moon if they're a brand-new character. On traverse:

1. Resolves the destination via `db.pre_tutorial_location_id` → fallback to "The Harvest Moon" → last-resort Limbo
2. Cleans up any lingering `tutorial_character` tags by collapsing the matching `TutorialInstanceScript` and removing the tag
3. Deletes any inventory items flagged with `db.tutorial_item = True`
4. Teleports the player and clears `pre_tutorial_location_id`

This pattern (cleanup-on-leave rather than cleanup-on-enter) means a crash or disconnect inside the tutorial leaves no orphan state in the player's persistent inventory.

### DungeonExit

**File:** `typeclasses/terrain/exits/dungeon_exit.py`
**Inherits:** `ExitVerticalAware`

Exit inside a procedural dungeon with lazy room creation. Points to its own location as a placeholder; on first traversal, asks the `DungeonInstanceScript` to generate the real destination room. Forward exits are gated by the `not_clear` tag (encounter clearance). Return exits always allow passage.

### DungeonPassageExit

**File:** `typeclasses/terrain/exits/dungeon_passage_exit.py`
**Inherits:** `ExitVerticalAware`

Exit at dungeon boundaries (back to the world). Removes the character's dungeon instance tag on traverse, and explicitly untags followers (since follower cascade bypasses `at_traverse`).

## Visibility Filtering

Exits participate in the game's visibility system at multiple levels:

| Check | Where | What it filters |
|---|---|---|
| `is_visible_to(looker)` | `get_display_exits()` | Auto-exit line `[ Exits: ]` |
| `is_visible_to(looker)` | `CmdExits.func()` | Verbose `exits` command |
| `is_visible_to(looker)` | `find_exit_target()` | `open`, `close`, `lock`, `unlock`, `picklock` |
| `is_visible_to(looker)` | `CmdLook.func()` | `look <direction>` |
| `is_open` | `get_display_exits()` | Closed doors hidden from auto-exits |

Hidden objects that fail visibility checks produce the message "You don't see 'X' here" (no period) — a subtle hint for observant players that something is there to find. Objects that truly don't exist produce "You don't see 'X' here." (with period).

## Direction Lookup

The `look <direction>` command intercepts direction abbreviations (n/s/e/w/ne/nw/se/sw/u/d and full names) before they hit Evennia's generic object search. This prevents single-letter abbreviations from matching room names, character names, or other objects via substring.

Room names are also excluded from `look <target>` matches — players who want to see the room just type `look`.

If a direction has no visible exit: "You see nothing special in that direction."

## Builder Helpers

**File:** `utils/exit_helpers.py`

**Authoring layer.** World content authors do not call these helpers directly — they declare exits in YAML (`exits:` blocks on rooms in fcm-world). The helpers below are the **internal primitives** the `evennia-world-builder` Loader composes when materialising YAML exit declarations into Evennia objects, plus the runtime path used by code that genuinely needs to construct exits on the fly (procedural dungeons, conditional routing rebinds). See [world-deployment.md](world-deployment.md) for the authoring story.

**CRITICAL: If a new exit type is needed, add a helper here first.** Never bypass this layer with bare `create_object()`. The library's Loader, the procedural dungeon system, and any future runtime exit creation should all go through helpers so that pairing, reverse-direction derivation, and door-link symmetry stay consistent everywhere.

All bidirectional helpers use the `OPPOSITES` dict to auto-derive the reverse direction.

### Bidirectional Exits (create exits in BOTH directions)

| Helper | Exit Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `connect_bidirectional_exit(room_a, room_b, direction)` | ExitVerticalAware | Standard passage. Optional `desc_ab`/`desc_ba` for custom exit names. `max_size` defaults to GARGANTUAN (unrestricted). Returns `(exit_ab, exit_ba)`. |
| `connect_bidirectional_door_exit(room_a, room_b, direction, key, ...)` | ExitDoor | Door pair with reciprocal open/close/lock sync via `link_door_pair()`. Accepts per-side open/closed descriptions, lock settings, `auto_close_seconds` (default 300). `max_size` defaults to MEDIUM (standard door). Returns `(door_ab, door_ba)`. |
| `connect_bidirectional_trapped_door_exit(room_a, room_b, direction, ...)` | TrapDoor + ExitDoor | Door pair with a trap on ONE side (`trap_side="ab"` or `"ba"`). Trap is directional — only fires when opened from the trapped side. Accepts all door params plus trap config and `auto_close_seconds` (default 300). `max_size` defaults to MEDIUM. Returns `(door_ab, door_ba)`. |
| `connect_bidirectional_tripwire_exit(room_a, room_b, direction, ...)` | TripwireExit + ExitVerticalAware | Passage pair with a tripwire on ONE side. Trap fires on traverse if undetected; safe step-over if detected. Accepts trap config. `max_size` defaults to GARGANTUAN. Returns `(exit_ab, exit_ba)`. |

### One-Way Exits (create a SINGLE exit)

| Helper | Exit Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `connect_oneway_loopback_exit(room, direction, key=None, destination=None)` | ExitVerticalAware | Boundary illusion — exit loops back to the same room by default, or to `destination` if supplied. `max_size` defaults to GARGANTUAN. Returns the exit object. |

## Mixins Used by Exits

> For the full shared mixin table (including world object mixins like SwitchMixin, ClimbableMixin, etc.), see [world-objects.md](world-objects.md).

Exit-specific mixins:

| Mixin | Provides | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| CloseableMixin | `is_open`, `auto_close_seconds`, `open()`, `close()`, `can_open()` | ExitDoor |
| LockableMixin | `is_locked`, `relock_seconds`, `unlock()`, `picklock()`, `lock()` | ExitDoor |
| HiddenObjectMixin | `is_hidden`, `find_dc`, `discovered_by`, `discover()` | ExitDoor |
| InvisibleObjectMixin | `is_invisible`, `is_invis_visible_to()` | ExitDoor |
| SmashableMixin | `smash_hp`, `take_smash_damage()`, `at_smash_break()` | ExitDoor |
| TrapMixin | `is_trapped`, `trigger_trap()`, `disarm_trap()` | TrapDoor, TripwireExit |
| ProceduralDungeonMixin | `enter_dungeon()` | ProceduralDungeonExit, ConditionalDungeonExit |

## Key Implementation Rules

1. **All exits MUST be authored in YAML** (`exits:` blocks on rooms in fcm-world). Runtime exit creation (procedural dungeons, conditional rebinds) MUST go through `utils/exit_helpers.py`. Never use bare `create_object()` for exits. If a new exit type isn't covered by an existing helper, create the helper first, then use it.
2. **All world exits should use ExitVerticalAware or a subclass** — never bare `DefaultExit`. The direction system and vertical checks are standard.
3. **Doors must be created in pairs** — the Loader handles this when authoring in YAML; runtime callers use `connect_bidirectional_door_exit()`. Unpaired doors will desync.
4. **Use `set_direction()`, not manual alias adds** — it handles both the attribute and aliases atomically.
5. **Distinct `door_name` values** when multiple doors exist in one room — prevents `open door` from matching the wrong one.
6. **at_traverse super() chain** — each exit class checks its own conditions then calls `super().at_traverse()`. Breaking the chain skips downstream checks (e.g. skipping ExitVerticalAware's height checks). Dungeon entry exits (`ProceduralDungeonExit`) intentionally skip super since they handle movement internally.
7. **Follower cascade bypasses exit at_traverse** — when a leader moves, followers are moved by `at_post_move` hooks, not by re-traversing the exit. Any cleanup that must happen for followers (e.g. dungeon tag removal) must be done explicitly in the leader's exit traverse.
8. **ProceduralDungeonMixin is a capability, not an exit type** — it provides `enter_dungeon()` but never overrides `at_traverse`. The host class decides when to call it. This allows dungeon entry to compose with any exit behavior.

## Test Coverage

The dungeon and exit systems have comprehensive test coverage across:
- Template registry and lookup
- Instance lifecycle (creation, collapse, tick-based expiry)
- Lazy room creation via DungeonExit
- Exit budget and branching constraints
- Boss room generation and encounter gating
- ProceduralDungeonExit (entry, group mode, follower rejection, already-in-dungeon)
- ConditionalRoutingExit (quest_active, quest_complete, has_tag, no condition, no alternate)
- ConditionalDungeonExit (quest-gated dungeon + fallback routing)
- Passage dungeons (return exits, terminal exits, tag cleanup)
- Shared instance mode (joining, persistence after empty)
- Follower teleport guard
