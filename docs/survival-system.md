# Survival System — Hunger & Thirst

> Per-character upkeep meters that depleting over time and can kill via the regen system. Both meters tick on the same global cadence and live in the same Evennia script (`SurvivalService`). Designed so future meters (sleep, sanity, fatigue) can plug into the same loop body without architectural changes.

---

## Overview

Survival meters are a deliberate friction tax on play — they exist to (a) give the resource economy a constant baseline demand, (b) anchor inn rooms and town fountains as load-bearing infrastructure, and (c) reward players for thinking ahead before leaving town. The design rules them by these constraints:

- **Naggy is the failure mode.** A meter that pesters the player every few minutes feels worse than no meter at all. Wider numerical ranges are preferred over faster tick cadences.
- **Death is real but slow.** Both meters can kill, but only after a long depletion + bleed window. Players can recover with food, water, healing, or fleeing back to town.
- **One global tick.** All meters share `SURVIVAL_TICK_INTERVAL` (currently 1200s = 20 minutes). Different rates are achieved by giving each meter a different number of stages.
- **Puppeted-only.** Meters tick only on characters that have an active session. Logged-out characters and superusers are exempt.

---

## SurvivalService

`typeclasses/scripts/survival_service.py` — a single global persistent Evennia script.

- Created at boot by `at_server_startstop._ensure_global_scripts`.
- Ticks every `settings.SURVIVAL_TICK_INTERVAL` seconds (20 min default).
- On each tick, walks all puppeted characters via `SESSION_HANDLER.get_sessions()`.
- For each character: skips superusers, then dispatches to one helper per meter — currently `_tick_hunger(char)` and `_tick_thirst(char)`. New meters drop in as additional helpers in the same loop.
- Each helper is independent: it reads the meter's current state, applies its own decrement rules, and writes back. No cross-meter coupling at the tick layer.
- The script was renamed from `HungerService` once the second meter (thirst) shipped. A one-shot cleanup in `at_server_start` (`_cleanup_renamed_scripts` + `_RENAMED_SCRIPT_KEYS`) deletes the stale `"hunger_service"` script row on the first boot post-rename so we don't end up with ghost services.

## Hunger

**Enum:** `HungerLevel` (`enums/hunger_level.py`) — 8 stages. Two intermediate no-penalty stages (NOURISHED, CONTENT) sit between SATISFIED and PECKISH to widen the pre-damage runway without accelerating the bleed phase.

| Stage | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| FULL | 8 | No effect; just-eaten state |
| SATISFIED | 7 | Regen normal |
| NOURISHED | 6 | Regen normal |
| CONTENT | 5 | Regen normal |
| PECKISH | 4 | Regen normal (last no-penalty stage) |
| HUNGRY | 3 | **Regen halts** (no penalty otherwise) |
| FAMISHED | 2 | **HP/MP/MV bleed** at ~30 min to death |
| STARVING | 1 | **Faster bleed** at ~15 min to death |

Death cause string: `"starvation"` (sent through `character.die()`).

**Decrement model:** one stage per `SurvivalService` tick. The constant decrement is applied via `HungerLevel.get_level(value - 1)`. STARVING is the floor — death is delivered through `RegenerationService.degenerate`, not by the survival tick itself.

**Free-pass-on-FULL:** when a character eats to FULL, `hunger_free_pass_tick` is set True. The next survival tick consumes the flag without decrementing — this prevents the awkward edge case where a player eats and immediately drops back to SATISFIED on the very next tick if the timing is unlucky.

**Sources of food (player-facing):**
- **Bread (resource ID 3)** — eaten directly via `eat` from inventory. The primary economic upkeep item.
- **Stew at an inn** — `stew` command in a `RoomInn`. Buys 1 bread via the AMM pool at the current market price, immediately consumes it, raises hunger by ONE level. Stew is a thin wrapper around the bread economy — it pulls liquidity from the AMM pool.
- **`forage`** (SURVIVALIST class skill, Druid/Ranger only) — restores hunger directly with no bread spend. Mastery scales yield (1–5 stages). 15-min cooldown matching the survival cycle. Deliberately does NOT set the free-pass tick, so bread retains its economic advantage. Requires forageable terrain (not urban/underground/dungeon/water). Forage ALSO tops up any water containers in the forager's inventory by N drinks — see Thirst → Sources of water below.
- **`cast 'relieve hunger'`** (Divine Healing school, BASIC mastery, cleric/paladin) — steps the hunger meter up by N levels where N = mastery tier. BASIC through EXPERT are caster-only; MASTER and GM apply to the caster plus all same-room group members (same targeting as shadowcloak). Mana scales 5/8/12/16/20. Refunds mana if no one needs feeding. Does NOT create bread — restores the meter directly the way forage does, so the farming/milling/baking AMM is untouched. Does NOT set the free-pass tick. Gated by mana cost, not a cooldown.

## Thirst

**Enum:** `ThirstLevel` (`enums/thirst_level.py`) — 12 stages, twice the range of hunger so the meter feels half as naggy at the same tick cadence.

| Stage | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| REFRESHED | 12 | No effect; just-drunk state |
| HYDRATED | 11 | No effect |
| QUENCHED | 10 | No effect |
| SLAKED | 9 | No effect |
| COMFORTABLE | 8 | No effect |
| AWARE | 7 | No effect; first nag message |
| DRY | 6 | **Regen halts** (parallel to HUNGRY) |
| THIRSTY | 5 | Regen halted |
| VERY_THIRSTY | 4 | Regen halted |
| PARCHED | 3 | **HP/MP/MV bleed** at ~35 min to death |
| DEHYDRATED | 2 | Bleed at ~25 min to death |
| CRITICAL | 1 | **Faster bleed** at ~15 min to death |

Death cause string: `"dehydration"`.

**Decrement model:** identical to hunger — one stage per `SurvivalService` tick, CRITICAL is the floor. Same `thirst_free_pass_tick` flag for the just-drunk edge case.

**Why 12 stages instead of 6:** keeps the tick cadence shared with hunger, but means a full container or a refresh from the inn buys the player twice as much real-time before they need to think about water again. Fewer interruptions.

**Sources of water (player-facing):**
- **Canteen** — small leather water container. Crafted by leatherworkers at BASIC mastery. Capacity: 5 drinks. Carried in inventory (not the HOLD slot — the player can drink while wielding a weapon and holding a torch). Refillable.
- **Cask** — wooden water container, twice a canteen's capacity. Crafted by carpenters at SKILLED mastery. Capacity: 10 drinks. Heavier than a canteen. Carried in inventory.
- **Fountain** in town — `FountainFixture` (`typeclasses/world_objects/fountain_fixture.py`). A `WorldFixture` with `is_water_source = True`. The `refill` command finds these in the room and tops up any held water container. First instance: Millholm Townsquare (sq_ne).
- **`Create Water` spell** — Conjuration school, BASIC mastery. Targets a held water container. Adds N drinks where N = mastery tier (BASIC +1 → GM +5), capped at the container's `max_capacity`. Mana scales by tier (3/4/6/8/10). Refunds mana if the target is already full. Mirrors forage's water credit scaling so a BASIC mage can't keep up with a sustained thirst load, but a GM mage can. Cooldown: 0 (utility, spammable — gated by mana cost).
- **Inn ale** — `ale` command in a `RoomInn`. Costs 1 gold (sink). Raises thirst by ONE stage per mug, parallel to how stew raises hunger by one level per bowl. Drink multiple ales to fully refresh. Sets the free-pass tick only when the drink lands the player at REFRESHED.
- **Forage water credit** (SURVIVALIST, druid/ranger) — when the forager runs `forage`, the same N points that restore hunger ALSO add N drinks to any water containers the forager is carrying. Most-empty container fills first, spilling into the next-emptiest if any drinks remain. If the forager has no container, no water credit (silently). Drinks beyond total room are discarded — you can only carry what your containers hold. Other party members do NOT get water from a foraging druid; they must forage their own. This deliberate rule keeps the canteen/cask supply chain intact (a "find water" skill produces drinks-into-a-container, not direct meter restoration) and matches the symmetric "no-free-pass-on-bread" decision for hunger.

**A drink restores one stage.** So a full canteen (5 drinks) carries the player from CRITICAL all the way to AWARE; a full cask (10 drinks) carries them from CRITICAL through to QUENCHED. Either is plenty for most ventures out of town.

## Container Mechanics — `WaterContainerMixin`

`typeclasses/mixins/water_container.py` — the shared mixin all water containers compose with `BaseNFTItem`. Same shape as `LightSourceMixin`:

- `max_capacity` (drinks)
- `current` (drinks remaining)
- `is_water_container` class flag — used by `drink`/`refill` to find containers
- `drink_from(character)` — decrements current, steps the character's `thirst_level` up by one (capped at REFRESHED), sets the free-pass tick on REFRESHED, persists state
- `refill_to_full()` — sets current = max_capacity, persists state
- `is_empty` / `is_full` properties
- `_persist_water_state()` — pushes `{current, max_capacity}` to `NFTGameState.metadata` via the standard `persist_metadata()` helper, so a half-full canteen survives bank/withdraw and chain export/import. Silently no-ops on non-NFT consumers. See `inventory-equipment.md` § NFT Metadata Persistence for the round-trip story.

Concrete typeclasses live in `typeclasses/items/water_containers/` (a new folder, distinct from `containers/` which is for backpacks-holding-items, and `consumables/` which is for delete-on-use items):
- `canteen_nft_item.py` — `CanteenNFTItem`, capacity 5, weight 0.5 kg
- `cask_nft_item.py` — `CaskNFTItem`, capacity 10, weight 2 kg, requires SKILLED carpenter

Both have `tracking_token` proxy tokens (`PCanteen`, `PCask`) registered in the NFTItemType migration alongside other proxy-tradeable items.

## Penalty Pipeline — `RegenerationService`

`typeclasses/scripts/regeneration_service.py` — the global script that runs every 20s and combines hunger + thirst into a single regen/degen/bleed decision.

- **Both meters must permit regen** for healing to fire. If hunger says PECKISH-or-better AND thirst says AWARE-or-better, regen runs normally (HP/MP/MV recover at base rate × position multiplier). Sleeping in a `sleep_policy: super` room (e.g., an inn) grants 5x regen instead of the standard 3x.
- **Either meter triggering degen** is enough to bleed. If hunger is FAMISHED-or-worse OR thirst is PARCHED-or-worse, the degen path runs once per minute (every 3rd 20s tick).
- **Worst-meter wins** for the bleed rate and death cause. Each meter contributes a `(cycles_to_death, death_cause)` candidate; the smallest cycles_to_death (i.e., fastest death) is used. Hunger wins ties, so "starved while also parched at the same lethal rate" is recorded as starvation.
- **Per-meter cycles_to_death:**

| Meter stage | Cycles to death (minutes) |
|---|---|
| HungerLevel.FAMISHED | 30 |
| HungerLevel.STARVING | 15 |
| ThirstLevel.PARCHED | 35 |
| ThirstLevel.DEHYDRATED | 25 |
| ThirstLevel.CRITICAL | 15 |

Bleed amounts: `max(1, round(stat_max / cycles_to_death))` per minute on each of HP, MP, MV. When HP hits zero, the character dies with the chosen cause string.

**Messaging:** `send_hunger_messages` and `send_thirst_messages` push first-person nags to the affected character (once they cross the no-penalty threshold) and third-person observation messages to the room (once they enter the bleed zone). The first/third person message strings live in the enum modules.

## Design Constraints (intentional gotchas)

- **Containers are inventory items, not held.** A canteen does NOT compete with weapons / torches for the HOLD slot. The model is "drink while you fight, like you eat bread while you fight" — friction without UX punishment.
- **Containers are NFTs.** They participate in the full NFT lifecycle: bank/withdraw, give, export to XRPL, re-import. The mirror metadata persistence layer carries `current` through every round-trip, so a half-full canteen sold on a marketplace shows the buyer exactly how much water they're getting.
- **Forage produces drinks-into-a-container, not a thirst free pass.** Forage gives a hunger free pass for druids/rangers (it restores hunger directly without needing bread), but its water credit explicitly does NOT bypass the canteen/cask supply chain — it tops up containers the forager is carrying, capped at their max_capacity, and silently no-ops if the forager has no container at all. This preserves the leatherworker/carpenter economy. The asymmetry is deliberate: hunger has a forager bypass because food is annoying to track on long expeditions and bread retains its economic dominance via the bread AMM; thirst has no bypass because containers are cheap, refills are everywhere, and the container itself is the gate.
- **The three survival utilities share a BASIC+1 → GM+5 design shape.** Forage, Create Water, and Relieve Hunger all scale the same way: BASIC restores/adds 1 unit, each tier adds another unit, GM tops out at 5. Forage and Relieve Hunger are direct-to-meter (no resource produced); Create Water is into-a-container (the container is the gate). None of the three creates a tradeable resource (bread, water) so the farming/milling/baking and the leatherworker/carpenter economies are left alone. The symmetry is intentional — it keeps the three class archetypes (druid/ranger, mage, cleric) balanced on survival utility without favouring one.
- **Create Water is fill-this-specific-container.** The shared `distribute_water_to_containers` helper in `water_container.py` walks inventory and fills most-empty first — used by forage and any future multi-container spell like Rain. Create Water deliberately does NOT use the walker because its `inventory_item` target type pins the player's choice of container.
- **Relieve Hunger does not create bread.** Unlike stew (which buys bread from the AMM) or eat (which consumes inventory bread), Relieve Hunger directly steps `hunger_level`. The farming/milling/baking economy and the bread AMM remain the canonical food supply. The spell is gated by cleric class + mastery + mana, which is a different axis from the druid/ranger forage gate — if a party has both classes they can double-dip, but that's expected and symmetric with having a druid and a mage covering water.
- **Stew is hunger only; ale is thirst only.** Inns serve both — the player chooses which meter to top up. Don't bundle them. Stew prices off the bread AMM; ale is a flat 1-gold sink (subject to change once a hops/ale resource exists).
- **Death by either meter routes through `character.die()`.** No special-case bypass. A starved corpse and a dehydrated corpse drop their loot the same way.

## Future Work

- **Sleep / fatigue meter** — third survival meter. Same `SurvivalService` loop, same shape, different penalty curve (probably no death, just regen halts). Likely tied to inn rooms (rest at an inn to clear it). The `sleep_policy` room tag is already in place — `super` rooms (inns) grant 5x sleeping regen and `none` rooms (town streets) block sleep entirely. Future guard/urchin/gaol mechanics can layer on top.
- **Climate-driven thirst rate** — desert zones tick thirst faster than temperate. Implementation: per-tick rate multiplier read from the room's terrain/climate before applying the decrement. Out of scope until desert content exists.
- **Natural water sources** — rivers, springs, the spring-fed pool tile in southern woods, and wells should all set `is_water_source = True` so the `refill` command picks them up. Trivial to add in zone builders; deferred until the second town is built.
- ~~**Find Water survival skill**~~ — landed as part of `forage` itself (not a separate skill). Forage now produces both hunger restoration and drinks-into-the-forager's-containers in one cast. See Thirst → Sources of water above.
- **Ale economy** — once a hops/ale resource exists, the ale command should price off an AMM pool (mirroring stew's bread pool) instead of the flat 1-gold sink.
- **Dehydration-specific death narrative** — the death system currently uses a generic cause string. A future pass could give dehydration its own dying-thoughts narrative the way starvation has flavour.
