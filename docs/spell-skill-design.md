# Spell & Skill Design Reference

Central source of truth for all crafting recipes, spell schools, their
progression, and spell system implementation architecture.

---

## Spell Design Philosophy

The starting point for designing any spell school is three anchor spells:

1. **Workhorse (BASIC).** Cheap, 1-round combat pacing, castable every round.
   Defines the school's identity and gives a caster something useful from
   day one. A mage who only knows their workhorse spell should still feel
   functional.

2. **"Fireball Equivalent" (EXPERT).** The double-edged sword — powerful but
   dangerous. An **unsafe AoE** that hits everything in the room including the
   caster and allies. The price of power is risk. DEX save for half damage, DC
   set by caster's roll. Safe to use at range (flying vs ground, or
   cross-room).

3. **"Wow Factor" (GRANDMASTER).** 100 mana, 5-round cooldown, massive single
   effect. The trophy spell that makes the school feel epic. Instant kills,
   total immunity, party portals, death interception — these are the spells
   people talk about.

Design the three anchors first, then fill in other spells around them at
SKILLED and MASTER tiers to round out the school's toolkit.

**Rules of thumb** (guidelines, not hard rules — adjusted for balance):

- **Mana cost:** ~1 mana per average point of damage. Conditions, utility, and
  AoE do not add extra cost. Individual spells may deviate for balance.
- **Cooldowns:** default cooldown equals the spell's `min_mastery` tier value
  (BASIC=1, SKILLED=2, EXPERT=3, MASTER=4, GM=5 rounds). Every hostile spell
  paces at least once per round. Override via `cooldown` class attribute on
  individual spells — set `cooldown = 0` for reactive/buff spells that must
  never gate other actions (Smite, Shield, Mage Armor). See the **Combat
  integration** section below for the unified action-economy detail.

**Example damage scaling** (not all spells scale this way):
- BASIC spells: +1d6 per mastery tier (e.g. Magic Missile adds a missile)
- SKILLED spells: +2d6 per mastery tier
- EXPERT+ spells: +3d6 per mastery tier

**AoE types:**
- **Unsafe AoE** — hits everything (caster, allies, enemies). DEX save for
  half.
- **Safe AoE** — hits enemies only with diminishing accuracy (100% / 80% / 60%
  / 40% / 20%).

## Skill Training System

### Overview

Skill mastery advances through **trainer NPCs** scattered across the game
world. Players spend gold and skill points at a trainer to advance a skill,
class skill, or weapon mastery one tier at a time. Training is the only way
to gain new mastery levels — skill points alone are not enough; the player
must find a qualified trainer.

### Trainer NPCs

A `TrainerNPC` is configured per instance with:

- **`trainable_skills`** — list of general/class skill keys this trainer teaches
- **`trainable_weapons`** — list of weapon type keys this trainer teaches
- **`trainer_class`** — which character class this trainer serves (e.g.
  `"warrior"`). Determines which class skill point pool is used for class
  skills.
- **`trainer_masteries`** — dict mapping skill/weapon key to the trainer's
  own mastery level (1-5). A trainer can teach any student whose current
  mastery is **strictly below** the trainer's. So a SKILLED trainer (2) can
  train a BASIC student (1) up to SKILLED, and a GRANDMASTER trainer (5)
  can train any student all the way up to GRANDMASTER. A trainer cannot
  teach a student who is already at the trainer's level or above.
- **`recipes_for_sale`** — dict of `{recipe_key: gold_cost}` for crafting
  recipes the trainer also sells.

### Three Resource Pools

Players have three separate skill point pools that can be spent on training:

| Pool | Source | Spent on |
|---|---|---|
| **General skill points** | Earned with character level | General skills (cartography, perception, stealth, etc.) |
| **Class skill points** | Earned per class with class level | Class-specific skills (bash, sneak attack, lay on hands) |
| **Weapon skill points** | Earned with character level | Weapon mastery (long sword, dagger, bow, etc.) |

The cost in points scales with the **target** mastery level — advancing to
higher mastery costs more points than advancing to lower mastery.

### Gold Cost

Training also consumes gold. The base cost scales with target mastery:

| Target Mastery | Base Gold Cost |
|---|---|
| BASIC | 10 |
| SKILLED | 25 |
| EXPERT | 50 |
| MASTER | 100 |
| GRANDMASTER | 200 |

**Charisma modifier:** the player's CHA score adjusts the gold cost. A high
Charisma character gets a discount (5% per modifier point); a low Charisma
character pays a surcharge. Minimum cost is always 1 gold.

Spent gold flows to the SINK location for reward recirculation.

### Training Flow

1. Player walks into a guild room containing a `TrainerNPC`.
2. Player types `train` to see the trainer's offerings — trainable skills,
   trainable weapons, costs, and current eligibility status.
3. Player types `train <skill>` or `train weapon <name>` to begin training
   a specific skill or weapon.
4. The system validates: trainer can teach (mastery gap > 0), player has
   enough gold, player has enough skill points, player is not already at
   GRANDMASTER, player is not already busy.
5. If validation passes, the player is shown a Y/N confirmation prompt with
   the full cost and outcome.
6. On Y: gold is deducted, a progress bar runs for the training duration
   (10-30 seconds depending on tier), and on completion the mastery is
   advanced and skill points are deducted.
7. On N: nothing happens. No gold spent, no points deducted.

### Compliance: Deterministic, No Random Failure

**Training always succeeds.** There is no roll, no chance of failure, no
"you wasted your gold" outcome. Once a player commits to training, they
receive exactly what the system promised them in the Y/N prompt.

This is a deliberate compliance design choice. An earlier version of the
training system rolled `d100` against a success chance derived from the
trainer-trainee mastery gap. On failure, gold was deducted, no
advancement occurred, and a one-hour cooldown was set on that trainer.
This pattern matched the textbook gambling triad:

1. **Consideration** — gold paid (and not refunded)
2. **Chance** — `randint(1, 100)` against success chance
3. **Prize** — mastery advancement (with downstream tradeable value via
   crafting and equipment)

Disclosing the success percentage in the prompt did **not** save the
mechanic. Showing the *odds* before payment is exactly what slot machines
do. Compliance requires disclosing the **outcome**, not just the
probability of an outcome.

The redesigned system removes the chance element entirely:

- The Y/N prompt shows: skill points cost, gold cost, training time,
  and the mastery advancement to be granted
- On confirmation, the player receives exactly that — no roll, no
  failure branch, no cooldown
- The trainer mastery gap is now a binary gate (can teach or can't teach),
  not a probability modifier
- Skill points and gold remain the rate-limiters of progression — they're
  scarce, and that's what creates the gameplay pacing

This aligns with FCM's overall compliance position:

> **No player will ever pay consideration for an outcome that is not
> fully disclosed to them before payment.**

See `compliance.md` and `ops/COMPLIANCE_LEGAL.md` §9.5 for the
full gambling law analysis. Other game systems that have been (or will
be) redesigned around the same principle:

- **Loot spawning** — fully deterministic budget-driven push, no per-kill
  rolls (see `economy.md`)
- **Gem enchanting** — pre-disclosed slot consumption model, redesign in
  progress (see `economy.md` § Weapons — Gem Insets)

### Recipe Sales

Trainer NPCs can also sell crafting recipes via the `buy recipe` command.
This is a simple gold-for-knowledge transaction — no rolls, no chance,
no failure. The player pays the listed gold cost and learns the recipe
immediately.

### Alchemy (Apothecary) — 19 recipes (9 BASIC + 5 SKILLED + 5 EXPERT)

#### Quality Tiers

Every potion receives a **quality prefix** based on the brewer's mastery (`PotionQuality` enum). Each tier is a separate `NFTItemType` row with its own prototype — effects are baked into the prototype and `default_metadata`, no post-spawn scaling code. Recipes use `mastery_tiered: True` and `cmd_craft.py` routes to the correct `NFTItemType` name via the enum.

| Mastery | Quality Prefix | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| BASIC | Watery | Watery Potion of the Bull |
| SKILLED | Weak | Weak Potion of the Bull |
| EXPERT | Standard | Standard Potion of the Bull |
| MASTER | Potent | Potent Potion of the Bull |
| GM | Ascendant | Ascendant Potion of the Bull |

A recipe only produces tiers at or above its minimum mastery: BASIC recipes produce all 5 tiers, SKILLED recipes produce 4 (Weak–Ascendant), EXPERT produces 3 (Standard–Ascendant).

#### Shop Tradeability

Only BASIC and SKILLED recipes have shop-tradeable tiers (proxy tokens on Watery/Weak tiers). EXPERT+ potions are player-crafted and player-traded only. Each shopkeeper lists whichever tier-specific names suit their area (e.g. beginner shops stock Watery only). Adding proxy tokens to new tiers later is a data-only change.

#### Ingredient Progression

| Tier | Base | Pattern |
|------|------|---------|
| BASIC | 1 Moonpetal Essence | + 2× one thematic ingredient |
| SKILLED | 2 Moonpetal Essence | + 1× each of two thematic ingredients |
| EXPERT | 1 Starbloom Nectar + 1 Moonpetal Essence | + 2× thematic (or 1+1 for Stoneskin) |

Recipe access (via scroll drops) is the primary gate, not ingredient availability. Ingredients are reused across tiers in new combinations. Starbloom Nectar (resource 44) is the EXPERT+ base — a rare resource found in high-altitude and magically charged zones.

#### BASIC Recipes (9) — stat buffs and restores

| Stat Buff | BASIC | SKILLED | EXPERT | MASTER | GM |
|-----------|-------|---------|--------|--------|-----|
| Bonus | +1 | +2 | +3 | +4 | +5 |
| Duration | 60s | 120s | 180s | 240s | 300s |

| Stat Restore | BASIC | SKILLED | EXPERT | MASTER | GM |
|--------------|-------|---------|--------|--------|-----|
| Heal | 2d4+1 | 4d4+2 | 6d4+3 | 8d4+4 | 10d4+5 |

| Recipe | Effect | Ingredients |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Potion of Life's Essence | HP restore | 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Bloodmoss |
| Potion of the Wellspring | Mana restore | 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Arcane Dust |
| Potion of the Zephyr | Move restore | 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Windroot |
| Potion of the Bull | +STR | 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Ogre's Cap |
| Potion of Cat's Grace | +DEX | 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Vipervine |
| Potion of the Bear | +CON | 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Ironbark |
| Potion of Fox's Cunning | +INT | 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Mindcap |
| Potion of Owl's Insight | +WIS | 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Sage Leaf |
| Potion of Silver Tongue | +CHA | 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Siren Petal |

#### SKILLED Recipes (5) — conditions and utility (exploration durations: 10/30/60/120 min)

| Recipe | Effect | Named Effect | Ingredients |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Potion of Feather Fall | Negate fall damage | `feather_fall` | 2 Moonpetal Essence + 1 Windroot + 1 Bloodmoss |
| Potion of Barkskin | +AC bonus (2/3/4/5) | `barkskin` | 2 Moonpetal Essence + 1 Ironbark + 1 Vipervine |
| Potion of Invisibility | Invisible condition | `invisible` | 2 Moonpetal Essence + 1 Arcane Dust + 1 Siren Petal |
| Potion of Detection | Detect invisible | `detect_invis` | 2 Moonpetal Essence + 1 Mindcap + 1 Ogre's Cap |
| Potion of Darkvision | See in darkness | `darkvision_buff` | 2 Moonpetal Essence + 1 Sage Leaf + 1 Mindcap |

Barkskin scales both AC bonus (+2/+3/+4/+5) and duration. All others scale duration only (condition is binary). Proxy tokens exist for Weak tier only.

#### EXPERT Recipes (5) — combat effects and advanced conditions

| Recipe | Effect | Named Effect | Scaling | Ingredients |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Potion of Haste | +1 attack/round | `hasted` | 30s / 60s / 120s | 1 Starbloom Nectar + 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Vipervine |
| Potion of Flight | Fly condition | `fly_buff` | 15min / 30min / 60min | 1 Starbloom Nectar + 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Windroot |
| Potion of Water Breathing | Water breathing | `water_breathing_buff` | 15min / 30min / 60min | 1 Starbloom Nectar + 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Bloodmoss |
| Potion of Comprehension | Comprehend languages | `comprehend_languages_buff` | 15min / 30min / 60min | 1 Starbloom Nectar + 1 Moonpetal Essence + 2 Mindcap |
| Potion of Stoneskin | Resist bludgeoning/slashing/piercing | `stoneskin` | 20%/60s, 35%/90s, 50%/120s | 1 Starbloom Nectar + 1 Moonpetal Essence + 1 Ogre's Cap + 1 Ironbark |

No proxy tokens. Haste and Stoneskin use combat durations; Flight, Water Breathing, and Comprehension use exploration durations.

#### EXPERT Recipes (future — not yet implemented)

| Recipe | Effect | Named Effect | Ingredients |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Potion of Enlargement | Increase size by 1 category | `enlarged` | TBD |
| Potion of Diminution | Decrease size by 1 category | `diminished` | TBD |

Enlargement and Diminution interact with the size-gating system on exits (`max_size`) — a Medium character who drinks Enlargement becomes Large and can no longer fit through standard doors, but gains reach/damage advantages. Diminution lets a Large creature squeeze through tight passages. Requires new `enlarged`/`diminished` named effects that temporarily modify `actor.size`.

#### MASTER Recipes (future — not yet implemented)

Planned potions requiring new effect mechanics (HP/mana trickle, damage multiplier):

| Recipe | Effect | Ingredients |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Potion of Regeneration | HP trickle over duration | 1 Starbloom Nectar + 1 Moonpetal Essence + 1 Arcane Dust + 2 Bloodmoss |
| Potion of Arcane Renewal | Mana trickle over duration | 1 Starbloom Nectar + 1 Moonpetal Essence + 3 Arcane Dust |
| Potion of Fire Resistance | Resist fire damage | 1 Starbloom Nectar + 1 Moonpetal Essence + 1 Arcane Dust + 2 Ogre's Cap |
| Potion of Lightning Resistance | Resist lightning damage | 1 Starbloom Nectar + 1 Moonpetal Essence + 1 Arcane Dust + 2 Ironbark |
| Potion of Cold Resistance | Resist cold damage | 1 Starbloom Nectar + 1 Moonpetal Essence + 1 Arcane Dust + 2 Sage Leaf |
| Potion of Enhanced Damage | 1.2× weapon damage (30s Potent, 60s Ascendant) | 1 Starbloom Nectar + 1 Moonpetal Essence + 1 Arcane Dust + 2 Siren Petal |
| Potion of Greater Invisibility | Invisible, doesn't break on attack | TBD |

Elemental resistance potions can use the existing `damage_resistance` effect type (same as Stoneskin). Regeneration, Arcane Renewal, and Enhanced Damage require new effect mechanics (trickle scripts, damage multiplier hook). Greater Invisibility requires a new `greater_invisible` condition.

#### GM Recipes (future — not yet implemented)

| Recipe | Effect | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Potion of Invulnerability | Stoneskin + all elemental resistances + AC bonus | Combined defensive — the "boss fight prep" potion. 30–60s duration. |
| Potion of Enhanced Damage (GM) | 1.3–1.4× weapon damage, 60s | GM scaling of the MASTER recipe |
| Potion of the Phoenix | Latent, untimed — on death: consume, heal to 25% HP, stay in fight | Unique mechanic — death processor checks for `phoenix` condition. Requires a phoenix feather ingredient (extremely rare drop). |

#### Anti-stacking

Named effect keys prevent doubling. Potions share named effect keys with their spell equivalents (e.g. both Potion of Invisibility and the Invisibility spell use `"invisible"`), so a player cannot stack a potion and spell of the same effect. Effects with stat bonuses (Barkskin, stat potions) MUST anti-stack. Condition-only effects (Darkvision, Feather Fall) use named effects for lifecycle/timer management; conditions are ref-counted so multiple sources are safe redundancy.

## Mage Spell Schools

### Evocation — Direct Damage

| Mastery | Spell | Role | Description |
|---------|-------|------|-------------|
| BASIC | Magic Missile | Workhorse | Auto-hit force. tier × (1d4+2) missiles. Sits above the BASIC damage cluster — pays more mana than Fire Bolt for guaranteed damage. Spammable, no save, no resistance interaction. |
| BASIC | Fire Bolt | Hit-roll DPS | d20+INT+mastery vs AC. tier × d8 fire. Can miss, crit on nat 20 doubles dice. Subject to fire resistance. |
| BASIC | Frostbolt | Debuff workhorse | 1d6 + (tier-1) cold + contested INT+mastery vs CON to apply SLOWED (1–5 rounds per tier). The SLOWED is the value, damage scales slowly so it sits well below the BASIC cluster. |
| SKILLED | Flame Burst | Safe AoE | 3–6d6 fire (per tier). Diminishing accuracy per target (100/80/60/40/20%). |
| EXPERT | Fireball | **Fireball eq.** | 8–14d6 fire (per tier), unsafe AoE, DEX save (DC = caster d20+INT+mastery) for half. Hits caster + allies. |
| MASTER | Cone of Cold | Safe AoE + CC | 10–13d6 cold (per tier). Safe AoE diminishing accuracy. Auto-applies SLOWED (1 round at MASTER, 2 at GM — see Known Discrepancies). |
| GM | Power Word: Death | **Wow factor** | HP ≤20 auto-kills (unless nat 1). HP >20 contested INT+8 vs CON+HD bonus; nat 20 always kills, nat 1 always fails. 100 mana, 5 round cooldown. |

### Abjuration — Protection & Dispel

| BASIC | Fear | CC | Contested INT+mastery vs WIS. FRIGHTENED for 1–5 rounds — target flees a random exit each round (or cowers if no exits). Save-each-round WIS to break early. HUGE+ immune. |
| BASIC | Raise Skeleton | Summon *(stub)* | Raise 1–3 weak skeleton minions from a corpse. 2–10 minute duration per tier. Consumes the corpse. |
| SKILLED | Vampiric Touch | Melee drain | Touch attack (d20+INT+mastery vs AC). 1–4d6 necrotic per tier. Caster heals **above** max HP. Mana cost scales dynamically (3%–95% of max) with the bonus HP bracket. 10-minute duration. |
| SKILLED | Raise Dead | Summon *(stub)* | Raise 1–4 corpses as undead minions. Minion count and duration scale with tier. Player corpses with equipment are protected. |

| BASIC | Find Familiar | Summon | Summons a familiar with remote control (see through eyes, move room-to-room, return on command). Tier determines creature type: rat (BASIC) → cat/stealth (SKILLED) → owl/flies (EXPERT) → hawk/flies+fights (MASTER) → imp/flies+fights+light (GM). One per caster. Persistent until dismissed or killed. |
| SKILLED | Knock | Utility | Magically unlocks AND opens any LockableMixin object (door, chest) whose `lock_dc` is within the caster's tier ceiling. Deterministic, no roll. SKILLED ≤ 15, EXPERT ≤ 20, MASTER ≤ 25, GRANDMASTER no limit. Cancels any pending auto-relock script on success. `target_type="world_item"` — targets are visibility-filtered (hidden/invisible objects must be discovered first). Mana is consumed even on out-of-tier failure (matches existing spell convention). Works on ExitDoor, WorldChest, TrapChest, and any future LockableMixin subclass via duck-typing. |
| SKILLED | Teleport | Utility *(stub)* | Self-teleport within range (district → zone → world by tier). Blocked by `no_teleport_out`/`no_teleport_to` room flags and DIMENSION_LOCKED. 60s cooldown. |

## Spell System Architecture

Spells are **class-based** (one Python class per spell) with a **registry** for discovery. This differs from recipes which are data-driven dicts — spells need per-tier execution logic that is genuinely different code, not just parametric scaling.

### Why Class-Based, Not Data-Driven

Some spells scale parametrically (magic missile: 1/2/3/4/5 missiles) but many have qualitatively different behavior per mastery tier:
- **Teleport**: basic=within area, skilled=within zone, expert=within continent, master=within world, GM=across worlds
- **Summon**: basic=rat, GM=dragon (different creatures, AI, duration)
- **Invisibility**: basic=breaks on attack, expert=breaks on cast only, GM=doesn't break

A unified class-per-spell system avoids the confusion of maintaining two systems (parametric vs custom) and lets any spell evolve from simple to complex without migration.

### Registry Pattern

```python
# world/spells/registry.py
SPELL_REGISTRY = {}

def register_spell(cls):
    SPELL_REGISTRY[cls.key] = cls()
    return cls

# world/spells/evocation/magic_missile.py
@register_spell
class MagicMissile(Spell):
    key = "magic_missile"
    aliases = []
    name = "Magic Missile"
    school = skills.EVOCATION          # skills enum member
    min_mastery = MasteryLevel.BASIC
    mana_cost = {1: 5, 2: 8, 3: 10, 4: 14, 5: 16}
    target_type = "hostile"

    def _execute(self, caster, target):
        tier = self.get_caster_tier(caster)
        missiles = tier
        total_damage = sum(dice.roll("1d4+2") for _ in range(missiles))
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - total_damage)
        s = "s" if missiles > 1 else ""
        return (True, {
            "first":  f"You fire {missiles} glowing missile{s} at {target.key}...",
            "second": f"{caster.key} fires {missiles} glowing missile{s} at you...",
            "third":  f"{caster.key} fires {missiles} glowing missile{s} at {target.key}...",
        })
```

**Base `Spell` class** (`world/spells/base_spell.py`) handles: mastery check, cooldown check (via shared `CombatHandler.skill_cooldown`), mana deduction, dispatch to `_execute()`, combat entry on hostile casts (via `should_enter_combat` per affected target), and cooldown application on success. Subclass per spell implements `_execute(caster, target)` which returns `(bool, dict)` with first/second/third person messages. Validation failures return `(False, str)`. Each spell also has `description` (short flavour text) and `mechanics` (multi-line rules/scaling text) for the future `spellinfo` command.

**Class attributes:**
- `key` — unique registry key (e.g. `"magic_missile"`)
- `aliases` — alternative names, default `[]` (most spells have none; players create their own shortcuts via `alias`)
- `name` — display name (e.g. `"Magic Missile"`)
- `school` — `skills` enum member (e.g. `skills.EVOCATION`). Use `spell.school_key` property for string lookups against `class_skill_mastery_levels` dict.
- `min_mastery` — `MasteryLevel` enum (BASIC=1 through GRANDMASTER=5)
- `mana_cost` — dict `{tier: cost}` (e.g. `{1: 5, 2: 8, ...}`)
- `target_type` — see Target Types section below

### Target Types

`target_type` is the spell's intent category. The cast/zap commands use it to drive target resolution before invoking `_execute()`. Two families:

**Actor targets** (resolved via `caller.search()`):

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"actor_hostile"` | An enemy in the room. Target required. Default triggers combat entry on the target. |
| `"actor_friendly"` | An ally in the room. Defaults to self if blank. No combat entry. |
| `"self"` | The caster, always. No combat entry. |
| `"none"` | No target. No combat entry. |
| `"actor_any"` | Any actor in the room. No combat entry by default — override `should_enter_combat` if a hostile-intent variant is needed. |

**Item targets** (resolved via `world.spells.spell_utils.resolve_item_target`):

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"inventory_item"` | An NFT item in the caster's own contents. Always visible to the owner — no hidden/invisible filtering. Examples: Mending, Recharge, Enchant Weapon. |
| `"world_item"` | An object or exit in the caster's room, filtered by `is_visible_to(caster)` so hidden/invisible objects are excluded until discovered. Delegates to `utils/find_exit_target.py` and inherits its directional qualifier handling ("door south"). Examples: Knock, Shatter. |
| `"any_item"` | Try `world_item` first (the room takes precedence), then fall through to `inventory_item`. Use only when a spell genuinely works on either context. |

Item-target spells receive the resolved item as `target` in `_execute()` and dispatch via duck-typing on the relevant capability (`hasattr(target, "is_locked")`, `hasattr(target, "durability")`, etc.) rather than `isinstance`. This keeps each spell content-complete for any future typeclass that adopts the same capability mixin.

**Knock** (Conjuration, SKILLED) is the worked example — see the Conjuration section below.

**Wand integration**: the same target_type vocabulary works for wand zaps. The `cmd_zap` command mirrors `cmd_cast`'s resolution branches and routes the spell through `spell.cast()` exactly as a memorised cast would, so any item-targeting spell becomes wand-craftable for free via the dynamic wand recipe system.

**File structure**: `world/spells/<school>/<spell_name>.py` — one file per spell, organised by school/domain.

**Discovery**: `@register_spell` decorator populates `SPELL_REGISTRY`. `__init__.py` per school folder imports all spell modules so decorators fire at import time.

**Registry helpers**: `get_spell(key)`, `get_spells_for_school(school)`, `list_spell_keys()`

### SpellbookMixin (typeclasses/mixins/spellbook.py)

Mixed into `FCMCharacter`. Provides `learn_spell()`, `knows_spell()`, `memorise_spell()`, `forget_spell()`, `is_memorised()`, `get_memorisation_cap()`, `get_known_spells()`, `get_memorised_spells()`. Storage: `db.spellbook` and `db.memorised_spells` (both `{spell_key: True}` dicts).

**Commands**: `cast`, `transcribe`, `memorise`/`memorize`, `forget`, `spells` — all in `commands/all_char_cmds/`.

### Mage vs Cleric Differences

| Aspect | Mage | Cleric |
|---|---|---|
| Schools | evocation, conjuration, divination, abjuration, necromancy, illusion (6 casting schools — enchanting is a crafting skill, not casting) | divine_healing, divine_protection, divine_revelation, divine_dominion (cleric/paladin); divine_judgement (**paladin only**); nature_magic (druid/ranger) |
| Learning | `transcribe <scroll>` — consumes spell scroll NFT | Auto-learn all spells at new skill tier when gaining a domain skill level (deferred) |
| Spellbook | Learned via transcribe | Populated automatically on skill-up |
| Memorise/Forget | Yes — memorise has delay, forget is instant | Same |
| Cast | From memory, costs mana | Same |
| Memorise cap | floor(mage_class_level / 4) + get_attribute_bonus(intelligence) + extra_memory_slots | floor(cleric_class_level / 4) + get_attribute_bonus(wisdom) + extra_memory_slots |

### Memory Slot System

- `extra_memory_slots` — cacheable stat from equipment (via `stat_bonus` effect type), follows standard pattern
- Cap checked at **memorise time only** — buff INT/WIS to memorise extra spells, they stay memorised when buff drops
- If spells are forgotten while at lower ability, re-memorising uses the lower cap
- Same universal pattern: `effective_cap = floor(class_level / 4) + get_attribute_bonus(ability) + extra_memory_slots`

### Spell Scroll NFTs

- `SpellScrollNFTItem` — `ConsumableNFTItem` subclass with `spell_key` AttributeProperty
- Mages consume via `transcribe` command — Y/N confirmation, then spell added to spellbook, scroll consumed
- Scrolls can also be cast directly (one-time use, no transcription, lower/no level requirement) — deferred
- Every mage spell has a corresponding scroll prototype in `world/prototypes/consumables/scrolls/`. Cleric spells are auto-learned on skill-up (no scrolls needed).

### Combat Integration

Hostile spells are full participants in the combat round system, not a
parallel track. Two hooks make this declarative and overridable per spell.

**1. Combat entry on successful cast.** `BaseSpell.cast()` invokes
`should_enter_combat(caster, target, result)` once per affected target
(primary + AoE secondaries) after `_execute()` succeeds. If it returns True,
`enter_combat(caster, target)` fires — the same entry point used by bash,
pummel, and the `attack` command. The target is pulled into a handler, sides
are assigned, initiative rolls, and the weapon ticker starts.

Default rule:

```python
def should_enter_combat(self, caster, target, result):
    return self.target_type == "actor_hostile"
```

Overrides handle conditional cases. The canonical example is Charm Person:

```python
def should_enter_combat(self, caster, target, result):
    # Successful charm = target controlled, no fight. Resist = target
    # knows you tried to dominate them and responds hostilely.
    return result.get("resisted", False)
```

Spells with non-hostile `target_type` (`actor_friendly`, `self`, `none`) never
aggro by default. Reactive spells that bypass `cast()` entirely (Smite, Shield)
are unaffected.

**2. Shared pacing counter.** Every cast sets
`handler.skill_cooldown = spell.get_cooldown()`. That counter is decremented
once per tick by the existing combat handler logic, and blocks any
subsequent spell cast **or** skill-special (bash, pummel, stab) while > 0.
Auto-attacks continue to tick independently — a caster still swings their
weapon every 4s while paced by the counter.

**Result payload keys** (optional, populated by spells that need conditional
overrides):

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `landed` | Did the effect apply (damage dealt, condition applied) |
| `resisted` | Did the target pass a save / win a contested check |
| `damage` | Aggregate damage dealt |
| `affected_targets` | Which secondaries were hit (AoE) |

Existing spells that don't populate these keep working — the default
`should_enter_combat` only needs `target_type` to decide.

### Spell Implementation Patterns

**Cooldown tracking:** A successful cast writes its cooldown to
`CombatHandler.skill_cooldown` — the same shared counter used by bash, pummel,
stab, and other combat specials. While it's non-zero the caster cannot cast
another spell **or** fire another skill-special; auto-attacks tick
independently. This enforces a unified one-special-action-per-round economy
across physical and magical actions.

Default cooldown is `min_mastery.value` (BASIC=1 .. GM=5) with a floor of 1 so
a default-configured hostile spell always paces. Per-spell override:
`cooldown = N` on the class (explicit 0 bypasses pacing — used by reactive
spells like Smite, Shield, Mage Armor).

Out of combat there is no handler, so `is_on_cooldown()` returns `(False, 0)`
and utility spells cast freely between fights. The first hostile cast calls
`enter_combat()` to create the handler, then the cooldown applies. See the
**Combat integration** section below for the end-to-end flow.

**Duration storage convention:** `_DURATION` dicts store values in their **natural human-readable unit**, then convert to the effect system's unit in `_execute()`:
- **Seconds-based effects** (`duration_type="seconds"`): store in **minutes** (e.g. `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 5}`), convert `* 60` before passing to `apply_named_effect()`. Examples: Invisibility, Sanctuary, Shadowcloak, True Sight.
- **Hours-based effects**: store in **hours** in `_SCALING` tuples, convert `* 3600`. Example: Mage Armor.
- **Combat-round effects** (`duration_type="combat_rounds"`): store in **rounds** directly — no conversion needed. Use `_ROUNDS` or `_SCALING` dict. Examples: Shield, Blur.
- **Display**: compute display string from the stored unit directly (e.g. `f"({duration_minutes} minutes)"`), not by reverse-converting from seconds.

**Recast refresh pattern** (for self-buffs like Invisibility, Sanctuary): if the effect is already active, compare new duration vs remaining time via `get_effect_remaining_seconds()`. Only refresh (remove + reapply) if gaining time. If existing is stronger, refund mana and return `(False, {...})`. This prevents downgrading a MASTER-tier cast with a BASIC recast.

**Range rules:** Spells use a `spell_range` attribute on the Spell base class (separate from the weapon `can_reach_target()` system):
- `"self"` — no height check (self-targeted spells like Shield, Mage Armor)
- `"melee"` — same `room_vertical_position` required (Vampiric Touch, Cure Wounds). Blocked across heights; mana not deducted on failure.
- `"ranged"` — any height within the room (default — Magic Missile, Fireball, Drain Life, etc.)
- Height validation runs in `Spell.cast()` before mana deduction. Spells that override `cast()` must replicate the check.
- Future: adjacent-room spells, ranged-in-melee penalty (Crossbow Expert feat analogue).

**Creature size tiers** (scaling mechanic for summons, knockback, reanimation): BASIC=Small, SKILLED=Medium, EXPERT=Large, MASTER=Huge, GM=Gargantuan.

### Spell Utility Helpers (world/spells/spell_utils.py)

- `apply_spell_damage(target, raw_damage, damage_type)` — applies damage with resistance check, triggers death.
- `get_room_enemies(caster)` — gets enemies via combat sides or NPC detection fallback. All heights.
- `get_room_all(caster)` — all living entities including caster (for unsafe AoE). All heights.
- `get_room_enemies_at_height(caster)` — enemies at the caster's `room_vertical_position` only.
- `get_room_all_at_height(caster)` — all living entities at the caster's height only.

### Spell Arguments (`has_spell_arg`)

Some spells take a free-text argument that selects a sub-mode or chooses among several effects. Set `has_spell_arg = True` on the Spell subclass and parse the argument inside `_execute()`.

Examples:
- **Resist Elements** — `cast 'resist' fire` selects which element to resist
- **Command** — `cast 'command' halt` / `grovel` / `drop` / `flee` selects which compulsion word
- **Locate Object** — `cast 'locate' <object name>` selects what to find
- **Disguise Self** — `cast 'disguise self' <name>` selects the disguise identity

The base `Spell.cast()` flow strips the argument before doing target resolution and passes it through to `_execute()` for the spell to interpret.

### Mana Refund on No-Op

A common pattern across self-buffs and condition-removal spells: if the cast would have no effect (target already at full HP, target already has the buff at equal or higher tier, target has no condition to cure), the spell **refunds the mana** and returns `(False, ...)` instead of consuming it. This prevents the player from accidentally burning mana on a cast that does nothing.

Spells using this pattern:
- **Cure Wounds** — refund if target is at full HP
- **Vigorise** — refund if target is at full movement
- **Cure Blindness** — refund if no BLINDED/DEAF to remove
- **Cure Poison** — refund if no poison and no resistance applies
- **Mage Armor** — refund if already armored at equal or higher tier
- **Divine Armor** — refund if already armored at equal or higher tier
- **Bless** — refund if already blessed
- **Sanctuary** — refund if existing sanctuary is stronger or has more time remaining
- **Shadowcloak** — refund if **all** group members in room are already affected
- **Light** / **Divine Light** / **Darkvision** / **Divine Sight** / **Detect Alignment** / **Water Breathing** / **Feather Fall** — refund on recast while existing effect has more remaining time
- **True Sight** / **Holy Sight** / **Invisibility** — refresh-only (won't downgrade), refund if existing is stronger

Pair this with the **recast refresh pattern** documented above: `get_effect_remaining_seconds()` is the canonical way to compare existing vs new duration before deciding to refresh, refund, or replace.

### Alignment-Based Scaling

A pattern for divine spells that punish evil targets: damage is multiplied by a function of the target's `alignment_score`, which is a public deterministic game-state variable (the same one used by the alignment system documented in [alignment-system.md](alignment-system.md)).

**Bolt of Judgement** is the reference implementation:

```python
multiplier = max(1, math.ceil(-target.alignment_score / 250))
```

This gives:

| Target alignment | Score range | Multiplier |
|---|---|---|
| Good or Neutral | ≥ 0 | 1× |
| Evil | -1 to -500 | 2× |
| Very Evil | -501 to -750 | 3× |
| Pure Evil | -751 to -1000 | 4× |

**Compliance note:** this mechanic uses **no random number generation**. The damage multiplier is a deterministic function of a publicly visible game-state variable (the target's alignment, which players can read via Detect Alignment and Holy Insight). It does not violate the gambling-law constraint that variable outcomes must be disclosed before payment, because the player can compute the exact damage multiplier before casting. See [compliance.md § Gambling Law](compliance.md#gambling-law--deterministic-distribution--pre-disclosure) for the broader principle.

This pattern is reusable for any divine spell that's meant to punish evil targets without introducing chance.

### Reactive Spells

Two spells trigger automatically during combat without consuming the player's action:

**Shield (Abjuration)** and **Smite (Divine Judgement — Paladin only)** are flagged as reactive — they cannot be cast manually with `cast`. Instead, the player toggles them on (`toggle shield`, `smite`) and the combat handler calls into `combat/reactive_spells.py` from inside the 14-hook attack pipeline:

- **Shield** triggers via `at_wielder_about_to_be_hit` (defender hook). Gates: toggle on, memorised, mana available, not already shielded. Effect: AC bonus for a few rounds. Mana cost is per trigger, not per round.
- **Smite** triggers via `at_post_attack` on a successful hit (attacker hook). Gates: toggle on, memorised, mana. Effect: bonus radiant damage on the triggering hit. Mana cost is per trigger.

The trigger happens inside the combat tick, so the player's normal action is unaffected. They get the benefit on top of whatever they were doing.

**Why this design:** lets reactive defensive spells coexist with active casting in a single round. A mage can swing a staff, get hit, have Shield trigger, and cast a Magic Missile all in the same combat tick. See [combat-system.md § Reactive Spells](combat-system.md#reactive-spells) for the combat-side of the integration and the full hook ordering.

### Familiar System (Find Familiar)

`Find Familiar` (Conjuration BASIC) is a major system in its own right rather than just a buff or summon. Brief overview:

- **Tier-based creature types:** rat (BASIC) → cat (SKILLED, stealth) → owl (EXPERT, flies) → hawk (MASTER, flies + fights) → imp (GM, flies + fights + light source)
- **One per caster** — dismiss or let die before recasting
- **Persistent** — survives logout and reload, not duration-limited
- **Remote control commands** — the caster can `look` through the familiar's eyes, send it to adjacent rooms, and recall it. Higher-tier familiars (hawk, imp) can also engage in combat on the caster's behalf.

The familiar system overlaps with the broader pet system. Full mechanics live in [pets-and-mounts.md](pets-and-mounts.md). The Conjuration spell file is just the entry point that creates the persistent familiar object and links it to the caster.

### Implementation Status

The school tables above are the source of truth for what's implemented vs scaffolded. Spells marked `*(stub)*` in those tables exist as files but their `_execute()` either raises `NotImplementedError` or returns `(False, ...)` without producing an effect.

**Current totals:** 76 spell files across 12 schools. **35 are real implementations**, **41 are stubs** awaiting either a blocking dependency or a design decision. The stubs are not ordered or prioritised here — that's tracked in `ops/PLANNING/0_BACKLOG`.

Common blocking dependencies for the stubs:

- **Damage immunity / death interception hooks** — needed for Invulnerability, Divine Aegis, Death Ward, Death Mark
- **Pet / retainer / minion system** — needed for Raise Dead, Raise Lich, Conjure Elemental, Greater Familiar control extensions
- **Room flag and portal system** — needed for Teleport, Dimensional Lock, Gate
- **CONFUSED condition** — needed for Mass Confusion (combat tick must override target selection randomly while still being deterministic from a player-action standpoint)
- **Trap and hidden-object exposure** — needed for Mass Revelation, Detect Traps full feature set
- **NPC spellcasting AI** — needed for Raise Lich (the lich casts Drain Life)
- **Group/party detection** — needed for Mass Heal, Holy Aura, Group Resist (the Shadowcloak pattern works but needs to be lifted out)

### Known Discrepancies

These are doc-vs-code mismatches that need a **design decision** rather than just a doc update — pick one and either fix the code or fix the doc.

| Item | Doc says | Code says | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cone of Cold SLOWED duration | 2 rounds at MASTER, 3 at GM | 1 round at MASTER, 2 at GM | The doc historically claimed 2/3; the code implements 1/2 via `_SLOW_ROUNDS = {4: 1, 5: 2}`. Pick one — update the table above and the code. Either is defensible from a balance standpoint. |
