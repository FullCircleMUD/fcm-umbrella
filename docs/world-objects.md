# World Objects — Fixtures, Interactions, and Mechanisms

> For exits and doors, see [exit-architecture.md](exit-architecture.md). For room types, see [room-architecture.md](room-architecture.md). For items (NFTs), see [inventory-equipment.md](inventory-equipment.md).

## Overview

World objects are non-NFT objects placed into rooms by zone builders. They provide environmental interactions — things players look at, open, climb, pull, search, read, and interact with. They are NOT blockchain-tracked.

There are **two base class lineages** for world objects, depending on whether the object is takeable:

- **`WorldFixture`** — immovable, `get:false` lock. The base for permanent environmental objects: signs, chests, climbables, switches, lit fixtures, library books. The bulk of this document is about `WorldFixture` and its mixins.
- **`WorldItem`** — takeable but non-NFT. The base for physical-but-non-blockchain items: keys, quest items, novelty props. `KeyItem` is the current concrete subclass.

Both lineages include `HeightAwareMixin` (vertical position + height-gated visibility) and `HiddenObjectMixin` (find-DC discovery).

## Base Classes

### WorldFixture (`typeclasses/world_objects/base_fixture.py`)

Foundation class for all permanent world objects.

**Provides:**
- `get:false` lock (immovable)
- `HeightAwareMixin` — `room_vertical_position`, `visible_min_height`/`visible_max_height` for height-gated visibility
- `HiddenObjectMixin` — `is_hidden`, `find_dc`, discoverable via `search`
- `InvisibleObjectMixin` — `is_invisible`, requires DETECT_INVIS to see
- `is_visible_to(character)` — combined visibility check

### WorldSign (`typeclasses/world_objects/sign.py`)

Read-only ASCII art sign. `sign_text`, `sign_style` (post/hanging/wall/stone). Display rendered via `return_appearance()`.

### WorldChest (`typeclasses/world_objects/chest.py`)

Closeable + lockable + smashable container with `FungibleInventoryMixin`. Starts closed. Contents gated on open state. Supports `loot_gold_max`, `spawn_scrolls_max`, `spawn_recipes_max` for unified spawn system integration.

### TrapChest (`typeclasses/world_objects/trap_chest.py`)

`WorldChest` + `TrapMixin`. Opening triggers the trap (whether or not it was detected via `search`). Smashing a trapped chest triggers the trap on all room occupants before breaking it open. Disarm via the `disarm` command (SUBTERFUGE skill check).

Builder sets `is_trapped`, `trap_damage_dice`, `trap_damage_type`, `trap_disarm_dc`, `trap_description` on the instance after creation.

### LitFixture (`typeclasses/world_objects/lit_fixture.py`)

Permanent light source — torch sconces, braziers, magical glow-crystals. The room's lighting system reads `is_lit` on any fixture present; a lit fixture satisfies the "has a light in the room" condition and suppresses the dark-room display. Unlike torches and lanterns (which are NFT items with consumable fuel), lit fixtures have no fuel management — they're permanent environmental lighting set by the builder.

### LibraryBook (`typeclasses/world_objects/library_book.py`)

Readable book that transports players to themed zones. `read <book>` shows flavour text and teleports the reader to the book's configured destination room. `recall` returns them to the library room they entered from. The entry point for the book-zone system (Hundred Acre Wood, etc.).

Both `read` and `recall` pace their flavour text paragraph-by-paragraph with a one-second beat between each, and lock the player in place (`ndb.book_transport`) so they can't move or re-trigger a transition mid-transport. Builders author `book_description` as plain text — `cmd_read` prefers explicit `\n\n` paragraph breaks and falls back to sentence splitting when none are present, so older single-string descriptions still pace nicely. The recall flavour is shared across all books and lives in `cmd_recall.py` (`RECALL_PARAGRAPHS`); only the read text is per-book.

### KeyItem (`typeclasses/world_objects/key_item.py`)

Takeable consumable key. Subclass of `WorldItem`. Matched to a lock via `key_tag` — `LockableMixin.unlock()` consumes (deletes) the key on successful use. Use for any lock that should cost a physical key to open.

### XPButton (`typeclasses/world_objects/xp_button.py`) — dev tool only

Dev-only fixture that awards XP when pressed. Place it in a test room to level a character up fast so you can inspect how different classes and skills operate at different mastery tiers. **Not for live world placement** — do not ship any zone that exposes an XPButton to players.

---

## Interaction Mixins

Composable mixins that add specific interaction capabilities to any world object.

### ClimbableMixin (`typeclasses/mixins/climbable_mixin.py`)

Allows characters to change `room_vertical_position` without the FLY condition. Used for drainpipes, ladders, ropes, vines, trees.

| Attribute | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `climbable_heights` | None | Set of supported heights, e.g. `{0, 1}` |
| `climb_dc` | 0 | DEX check DC. 0 = auto-succeed |
| `climb_up_msg` | "You climb upwards." | Success message going up |
| `climb_down_msg` | "You climb downwards." | Success message going down |
| `climb_fail_msg` | "You fail to get a grip..." | Failure message |

**Command:** `climb up/down <target>` (`commands/all_char_cmds/cmd_climb.py`)
**Concrete typeclass:** `ClimbableFixture(ClimbableMixin, WorldFixture)`
**Fall safety:** `BaseActor._check_fall()` checks for climbable fixtures before dealing fall damage — character slides down safely if a fixture supports their height.

**First instance:** Drainpipe in Back Alley, Millholm Rooftops entry point.

### SwitchMixin (`typeclasses/mixins/switch_mixin.py`)

Generic toggle mechanism — levers, buttons, valves, anything that turns on/off to trigger an effect. The mixin provides the mechanism; the effect is always custom via hooks.

| Attribute | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `is_activated` | False | Current toggle state |
| `switch_verb` | "pull" | Action verb ("pull", "push", "turn", "flip") |
| `switch_name` | "switch" | Display name ("lever", "button", "valve") |
| `can_deactivate` | True | False = one-way switch, can't toggle back |
| `activate_msg` | "You {verb} the {name}." | First-person activation message |
| `deactivate_msg` | "You {verb} the {name} back." | First-person deactivation message |

**Methods:**
- `activate(caller)` → sets `is_activated = True`, calls `at_activate(caller)` hook
- `deactivate(caller)` → sets `is_activated = False`, calls `at_deactivate(caller)` hook
- `at_activate(caller)` — **override this** to define the effect (disarm trap, open door, etc.)
- `at_deactivate(caller)` — **override this** to define the reverse effect

**Command:** `pull/push/turn/flip <target>` (`commands/all_char_cmds/cmd_switch.py`)
**Concrete typeclass:** `SwitchFixture(SwitchMixin, WorldFixture)`

**Usage example (zone builder):**
```python
class TrapLever(SwitchMixin, WorldFixture):
    switch_verb = AttributeProperty("pull")
    switch_name = AttributeProperty("lever")

    def at_activate(self, caller):
        for obj in self.location.contents:
            if hasattr(obj, "trap_armed"):
                obj.trap_armed = False
                caller.msg("You hear a click as the trap mechanism disengages.")
```

### Height-Gated Visibility (`HeightAwareMixin`)

Any object with `HeightAwareMixin` can optionally set `visible_min_height` / `visible_max_height` to restrict which characters can see it based on their `room_vertical_position`. None = no restriction (default).

- `RoomBase.get_display_things()` filters by `is_height_visible_to(looker)`
- `RoomBase.get_display_characters()` filters by `is_height_visible_to(looker)`

**Example:** Sunken wreck at depth -2 with `visible_max_height = -1` — only visible when diving.

## Trap System

See `typeclasses/mixins/trap.py` and subclasses. Traps can be placed on:
- **Doors** (TrapDoor) — triggers on open
- **Chests** (TrapChest) — triggers on open
- **Exits** (TripwireExit) — triggers on traverse if undetected
- **Rooms** (PressurePlateRoom) — triggers on attempted leave

**Builder helper:** `connect_trapped_door()` in `utils/exit_helpers.py` — creates a bidirectional door pair with a trap on one side.

**Detection:** Passive (`_check_traps_on_entry` in `at_post_move`) and active (`search` command).
**Disarming:** `disarm` command (SUBTERFUGE skill check) or SwitchMixin levers (custom wiring).
