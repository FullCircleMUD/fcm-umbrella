# Unified Search and Targeting System

> Technical design document for the MUD-wide target-resolution layer. Every command that takes a keyword-named target routes through this system. For spell-specific targeting rules see [spell-skill-design.md](spell-skill-design.md). For combat targeting see [combat-system.md](combat-system.md). For exit/door resolution see [exit-architecture.md](exit-architecture.md).

## The Trigger

A player typed `cast drain life bee-1` in a room called "Under Bee Tree". The spell command called `caller.search("bee-1")` with no `candidates=` argument. Evennia's default candidate list includes the room object itself, so the substring "bee" in "Under Bee Tree" matched the room's key. The spell received the room as its target and crashed in `take_damage()`.

This was not a spell bug. It was a **naming-resolution bug** that could reproduce in any command calling `caller.search()` without thinking carefully about scope. The stopgap fix — a dedicated `resolve_actor_target` helper in `spell_utils.py` — closed the immediate crash, but exposed a deeper problem: every command in FCM that takes a target keyword was implementing its own filter logic around bare `caller.search()`, and the logic drifted from command to command. Some filtered characters. Some didn't. Some respected hidden-object mixins. Some didn't. A single bug in one command hinted at a class of bugs spread across dozens.

## Why a Unified System

The real problem was not any single call site. It was **drift between implementations**. When every command implements its own "find a thing by name" logic, small inconsistencies become silent behavioural differences, and a fix in one command never propagates to the others. A new developer (human or AI) writing a new command starts by copying an existing call site, inheriting whatever filter semantics the donor happened to use, which may or may not be correct.

A unified targeting layer solves this by centralising the question "which object did the player mean?" into a small set of named, tested helpers. Every command that takes a target calls the same library. When a filter rule changes (e.g. visibility gets a new gate), one change to the library propagates to every consumer automatically. Call sites express **intent** (`items_room_nonexit`, `actor_hostile`), not implementation details. A future reader can see at a glance what a command is looking for without reverse-engineering a `candidates=` list.

This is not about building new search machinery. It is about making the machinery we already have **consistent** across the entire codebase.

## First Principle: Evennia-First

Before building anything new, check what Evennia already provides.

The earliest drafts of this design proposed a multi-layer custom targeting library: a `walk_scope` primitive, `scope_*` functions for every common scope, a custom `name_match` helper, and a full resolver catalog. A careful read of `evennia/objects/objects.py` revealed that most of the supposed gaps don't exist. Evennia already supports scoped searches via `location=`, typeclass and tag filters, nick substitution, numeric disambiguation, lock filtering, dbref lookups, and special-keyword shortcuts (`me`/`self`/`here`). FCM's messy target-resolution code was largely a case of **not reading the signature** before writing custom helpers that reinvented Evennia's existing machinery.

This shaped the rule that every new library entry must pass: **does Evennia already do this?** If yes, call Evennia directly and don't wrap. If no, build the thinnest possible layer that adds what Evennia cannot know about — FCM-specific semantics (mixins, combat state, game rules) — and delegate everything else.

The rule lives in [CLAUDE.md](../src/game/CLAUDE.md) § Development Approach as a general development discipline. This library is the first worked example of applying it.

## What Evennia Already Provides

Cataloging what `DefaultObject.search()` (in `evennia/objects/objects.py`) does natively before specifying any custom layer. Everything in these tables is a one-line call to `caller.search()` with the right kwarg — no new code needed.

### `caller.search()` keyword arguments

| Kwarg | Effect |
|---|---|
| `candidates=[...]` | Restrict to a pre-built list. The escape hatch for any custom filtering. |
| `location=<obj>` | Scope to `obj.contents`. Accepts a list of locations. |
| `location=caller` | **Searches the caller's inventory.** `caller.contents` is the inventory. |
| `location=caller.location` | **Searches the caller's current room only.** Excludes inventory AND the room object itself. |
| `location=container` | **Searches inside a container.** Same mechanism as the caller/room cases. |
| `typeclass=Path` or `typeclass=[...]` | Match only objects of the given typeclass(es). |
| `tags=[("tag", "cat"), ...]` | Match only objects bearing the given tag(s). |
| `attribute_name="foo"` | Search a specific attribute instead of key + aliases. |
| `quiet=True` | Suppress error messages; return a list instead of a single match. Caller owns messaging. |
| `exact=True` | Require full-string match. Default is substring/prefix. |
| `use_nicks=True` (default) | Apply the caller's object nicks before matching — free alias support for every call. |
| `use_locks=True` (default) | Honour the `search` lock — objects with `search:false()` are invisible to non-staff. |
| `stacked=N` | If multiple matches are identical (three stacked potions), return up to N instead of erroring. |
| `global_search=True` | Search the entire DB. |
| `use_dbref=True/False/None` | Allow `#123` lookups. Auto-enabled for Builders. |
| `nofound_string` / `multimatch_string` | Override default error strings on a per-call basis. |

### Behaviour Evennia gives you for free

- **`me` / `self` / `here` keywords** resolve without touching the candidate list, handled by `get_search_direct_match` before any filtering runs.
- **`<num>-<string>` numeric disambiguation** — a player types `goblin-2` and Evennia parses it to "the second goblin" via `settings.SEARCH_MULTIMATCH_REGEX`. No custom parser needed.
- **Multimatch error formatting** — when the player's keyword matches several objects, Evennia formats the `goblin-1 / goblin-2 / goblin-3` disambiguation list automatically.
- **Case-insensitive prefix/substring matching** against both `obj.key` and `obj.aliases.all()`.
- **Input whitespace normalisation.**
- **`#dbref` lookups** routed through the global DB instead of candidate filtering.

### FCMCharacter.search extension (pre-existing)

[FCMCharacter.search](../src/game/typeclasses/actors/character.py#L495) extends Evennia's search with a **substring fallback** (matches anywhere in the key, not just prefix), and two custom kwargs:

- `exclude_worn=True` — filters equipped items out of results. Used by drop/give/deposit.
- `only_worn=True` — restricts to equipped items. Used by remove.

This override predates the targeting library and is still the right place for those behaviours — they are extensions to the STRING MATCHING layer, not the semantic filter layer. The library's helpers delegate to `caller.search()` and therefore inherit the FCMCharacter extension automatically.

### Evennia helpers for predicate bodies

When the library writes predicates, it leans on existing Evennia primitives rather than reinventing them:

| Question | Evennia primitive |
|---|---|
| Does this object pass a lock? | `obj.access(caller, "get")`, `obj.access(caller, "search")`, etc. |
| Does this object have a tag? | `obj.tags.has(name, category=...)` |
| Is this object of a typeclass? | `obj.is_typeclass(path, exact=False)` |
| Does this object have an alias? | `obj.aliases.all()` |
| Is a script attached? | `obj.scripts.get("key")` |
| What exits does this room have? | `room.exits` (Evennia provides a filtered view) |
| What is in a container? | `obj.contents` |

## What Evennia Does Not Provide

With the native catalog laid out, the honest gap list is small:

1. **FCM-specific semantic predicates** — runtime-state filters Evennia cannot know about. Examples: `hp > 0`, `at this height`, `in this combat side`, `in this follow-chain group`, `visible via HiddenObjectMixin`, `is a ContainerMixin subclass`. Every one of these can be expressed as a tiny `(obj, caller) -> bool` function. None exist in Evennia because they are all FCM rules.

2. **Typed intent at call sites** — Evennia's `search()` always returns `Object | None | list[Object]`. From the call site you cannot tell whether the caller wanted a hostile actor, a held item, a lockable door, or an NPC. Type errors surface as runtime `AttributeError` downstream — which is exactly how the bee tree crash manifested. Named building blocks and composites close this gap at the architecture level.

3. **AoE multi-target shape (shipped)** — `resolve_target` returns `(target, secondaries)` where the secondaries list is built by `_resolve_aoe_secondaries` from the primary target's height, filtered by `aoe` type (unsafe/safe/allies/etc). All five AoE spells migrated. See the AoE section below.

## The Library We Built

### Module layout

```
src/game/utils/targeting/
    __init__.py          — empty exports (no API surface at the package level)
    predicates.py        — (obj, caller) -> bool filters
    helpers.py           — walk_contents, bucket_contents, building blocks,
                           composites, priority-bucketed actor resolvers,
                           resolve_target entry point

src/game/utils/direction_parser.py
    parse_direction()    — splits "door south" → ("door", "south")
                           Used by exit-interacting commands
```

### Predicate library

Each predicate is a pure `(obj, caller) -> bool` function, 3–8 lines long, with its own unit test. Factory predicates return a closure bound to caller-specific state at creation time.

| Predicate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `p_not_actor` | `not isinstance(obj, DefaultCharacter)` — excludes all actors (PCs, NPCs, mobs, pets, mounts). Vocabulary: "actor" = any DefaultCharacter subclass. |
| `p_is_character` | `isinstance(obj, FCMCharacter)` — matches player characters only, not NPCs/mobs/pets. |
| `p_not_exit` | `not isinstance(obj, DefaultExit)` — excludes exits from item candidates. |
| `p_visible_to` | **Stealth gate.** Delegates to `obj.is_hidden_visible_to(caller)` when the `HiddenObjectMixin` method exists; returns True otherwise. |
| `p_height_visible_to` | **Spatial gate.** Delegates to `obj.is_height_visible_to(caller)` — checks the room's visibility barriers against the object's size. Objects small enough to be concealed by a barrier between observer and object are hidden. Same-height objects are always visible. |
| `p_can_see` | **Composite gate.** `p_visible_to AND p_height_visible_to`. Use for display/perception paths (look, scan) where "can the player see this?" is the whole question. Extensible — future visibility gates (ethereal, fog-of-war) get added here and propagate to all consumers. |
| `p_living` | `hp > 0` — excludes items (hp=None), corpses (hp=0), dead mobs. Defensive on type. |
| `p_in_combat` | Has a `combat_handler` script attached. Combat-specific runtime-state filter. |
| `p_is_container` | `getattr(obj, "is_container", False)` — matches `ContainerMixin`. Corpses are NOT containers. |
| `p_is_lockable` | `hasattr(obj, "is_locked")` — type check for `LockableMixin`. Does NOT check current lock state. |
| `p_is_locked` | `getattr(obj, "is_locked", False)` — state check, True if currently locked. |
| `p_is_openable` | `hasattr(obj, "is_open")` — type check for `CloseableMixin`. Does NOT check current open/closed state. |
| `p_is_open` | `getattr(obj, "is_open", False)` — state check, True if currently open. |
| `p_passes_lock(lock_type)` | **Factory** returning a predicate wrapping `obj.access(caller, lock_type)`. |
| `p_same_height(caller)` | **Factory** returning a predicate matching objects at the caller's `room_vertical_position`. Used by melee-range spells. |
| `p_different_height(caller)` | **Factory** — inverse of `p_same_height`. For future `ranged_only` spells. |
| `p_same_height_value(height)` | **Factory** matching objects at an explicit height value. Used by AoE secondaries where height comes from the primary target, not the caster. |
| `p_involved_with(caster)` | **Factory** matching actors involved with the caster — combat participants in combat, group members out of combat. Used for bystander protection in non-PvP rooms. |

**Visibility predicate family:**

The three visibility predicates serve different roles:

- `p_visible_to` — stealth only. Used in targeting resolvers where height is handled separately by range predicates (`p_same_height`, `p_different_height`).
- `p_height_visible_to` — spatial only. Used by room display methods that have their own stealth logic.
- `p_can_see` — composite of both. Used for display/perception paths (look, scan, climb, search) and as an `extra_predicates` entry in command-layer calls where "can the player perceive this?" is the whole question.

Each predicate has a docstring explaining what Evennia handles natively instead. [predicates.py](../src/game/utils/targeting/predicates.py) opens with a detailed comment block listing the dozen-plus filters a developer should implement with a native Evennia kwarg instead of adding a predicate.

### The walk primitive

```python
def walk_contents(caller, source, *predicates):
    """Walk source.contents once and return objects passing every predicate."""
    if source is None:
        return []
    contents = getattr(source, "contents", None)
    if not contents:
        return []
    return [
        obj for obj in contents
        if all(p(obj, caller) for p in predicates)
    ]
```

Universal targeting primitive. Short-circuits per-object via Python's `all()` so the first failing predicate stops evaluation for that object. Returns an empty list if `source` is `None` or has no `.contents`, so callers can iterate unconditionally.

**Predicate order matters**: cheap predicates (identity/attribute checks) should come before expensive ones (method calls, lock checks) so short-circuit eval pays off.

**No shared base constant.** Each call site declares its own predicate stack explicitly. There is no `BASE_ITEM_PREDICATES` — it was removed because it made developers lazy about evaluating what their specific building block actually needs to filter.

### `bucket_contents`

```python
def bucket_contents(caller, source, key_fn, *predicates, order=None):
    """Walk source.contents once, filter via predicates, bucket via key_fn."""
```

Single-pass sibling of `walk_contents`. Objects passing all predicates are classified by `key_fn(obj, caller)` into named buckets. Returns `{bucket_name: [objects]}`. When `order` is supplied, pre-populates those keys (with empty lists) and preserves insertion order for priority-based iteration.

Primary consumer: `combat.combat_utils.get_sides` (partitions living combatants into allies/enemies). Also used by the priority-bucketed actor resolvers and designed for future AI threat bucketing.

### Direction parser

[`utils/direction_parser.py`](../src/game/utils/direction_parser.py) — `parse_direction(text)` splits player input into `(name, direction)` by checking each word against `ExitVerticalAware.DIRECTION_ALIASES`:

```python
parse_direction("door south") → ("door", "south")
parse_direction("south door") → ("door", "south")
parse_direction("s door")     → ("door", "south")
parse_direction("south")      → ("", "south")
parse_direction("chest")      → ("chest", None)
```

Used by exit-interacting commands (open, close, lock, unlock, picklock, disarm_trap). When a direction is parsed, the command uses `items_room_exit_by_direction` — directional qualification means the player is targeting an exit, so room objects and inventory are not searched.

### Design decisions worth documenting

1. **Identification-only, not action-gating.** The library answers "which object did the player mean?" and stops. Every gate that depends on command intent (open/closed, access locks, hooks, weight checks) stays in the command layer. This keeps the building blocks pure, testable, and reusable across commands with different action semantics.

2. **Delegate string parsing to `caller.search()`.** The library never reimplements nick substitution, dbref lookup, `<num>-<string>` disambiguation, `me`/`self`/`here` shortcuts, `stacked`, or `use_locks`. All of these come for free via `caller.search(candidates=..., **kwargs)`.

3. **No shared base predicates.** Each building block declares its own predicate stack explicitly. This forces every new building block to evaluate what it actually needs to filter, rather than lazily inheriting a "standard" set that may or may not be appropriate.

4. **Fail-soft on missing source.** `None` source or missing `.contents` returns `None` / `[]`, never raises. Lets callers try multiple sources speculatively.

5. **No override of Evennia's `search()`.** An earlier draft proposed overriding `get_search_candidates` to strip the room from the default candidate list. We rejected that approach: the typed building blocks make the footgun structurally impossible for every migrated call site, and overriding `get_search_candidates` fights Evennia's intentional behaviour (`look here` needs the room in candidates).

6. **Predicate extraction is demand-driven.** Every predicate in the library was added when a concrete consumer needed it, not because it might be useful one day.

7. **Base targeting vs filtered targeting — choose per command.** The targeting system provides two levels of resolution:

   - **Base targeting** — "find the visible thing the player named." Uses broad building blocks that don't filter by object type. Every command needs at least this.
   - **Filtered targeting** — "find the visible thing the player named that's ALSO a container / gettable / an enemy / at this height." Uses narrow building blocks. Commands use this when "not found" is the right answer for a type mismatch.

   The choice is **per command, per code path**, based on what error messaging serves the player best:

   - `cmd_put ... in backpack` → **filtered**. If backpack isn't a container, "not found" is fine.
   - `look in sword` → **broad** (find the item, then check `is_container`). "Not a container" is more helpful than "not here."
   - `cmd_get sword` → **broad** (`items_room_nonexit`). If the sword is a fixture, "can't get that" beats "not here."
   - `cmd_attack shopkeeper` → **broad** (`actor_hostile` finds the shopkeeper). Command checks room combat permission.

8. **Predicates are vocabulary, not just filters.** Predicates define *what a concept means* — "visible," "at this height," "is a container." Where a predicate gets evaluated is a separate decision. The same predicate function serves three roles:

   - **Automatic filter** inside `walk_contents` / `bucket_contents` — the resolver never sees objects that fail the predicate.
   - **Explicit check** in a command's `if` branch — the command calls the predicate directly on a resolved object for bespoke decisions.
   - **Display filter** in room appearance / look / scan — the predicate post-filters a contents list for perception purposes.

   Even when a command uses broad (unfiltered) targeting, the predicates are still the consistent, single-source-of-truth way to ask questions about the resolved object.

## Building Blocks

Building blocks are singular target types — each searches one scope with one predicate stack. The command supplies them via `target_type` to `resolve_target`. Building blocks declare only **structural** predicates (what kind of object). Visibility, height, and command-specific checks are the caller's responsibility via `extra_predicates` or post-resolution checks at the command layer.

### Item building blocks

| Building block | Scope | Structural predicates | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `items_inventory` | `caller.contents` | none | Actors/exits/fixtures can't exist in inventory. `exclude_worn=True` via search kwarg. |
| `items_equipped` | `caller.contents` | none | `only_worn=True` via search kwarg. |
| `items_room_all` | `room.contents` | `p_not_actor` | Broadest room scope — includes exits, fixtures, loose items, containers, doors. |
| `items_room_exits` | `room.exits` | none (Evennia's native exit filter) | Name-based exit lookup. Uses Evennia's `room.exits` filtered view. |
| `items_room_exit_by_direction` | `room.exits` filtered by `direction` kwarg | direction match | Direction-based exit lookup. Requires `direction` kwarg from `parse_direction()`. |
| `items_room_nonexit` | `room.contents` | `p_not_actor`, `p_not_exit` | Standard scope for most item commands — everything except actors and exits. |
| `items_room_gettable` | `room.contents` | `p_not_actor`, `p_not_exit`, `p_passes_lock("get")` | Narrowest non-exit scope — only loose, takeable items. |
| `items_room_fixed` | `room.contents` | `p_not_actor`, inverse of `p_passes_lock("get")` | Non-gettable objects including exits/doors. Inverse of `items_room_gettable`. |
| `items_room_fixed_nonexit` | `room.contents` | `p_not_actor`, `p_not_exit`, inverse of `p_passes_lock("get")` | Non-gettable objects excluding exits. Fixtures only. |

### Actor building blocks

| Building block | Scope | Structural predicates | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `actors_in_combat` | `room.contents` | `p_living`, `p_in_combat` | Living actors with combat_handler. No priority bucketing. |
| `actors_not_in_combat` | `room.contents` | `p_living`, inverse of `p_in_combat` | Living idle actors. |

## Composites

Composites chain multiple building blocks with fallback logic. Step 1 searches first; if no match, step 2 searches the fallback scope. Both steps pass `extra_predicates` through.

| Composite | Step 1 | Step 2 | Consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `items_room_all_then_inventory` | Room (all non-actor, incl. exits) | Inventory (exclude worn) | Knock spell |
| `items_inventory_then_room_all` | Inventory (exclude worn) | Room (all non-actor, incl. exits) | Identify, Holy Insight |
| `items_inventory_then_room_nonexit` | Inventory (exclude worn) | Room (non-actor, non-exit) | cmd_look "look in" container |
| `items_room_all_then_room` | Room contents (all non-actor) | Room itself (unconditional fallback) | cmd_disarm_trap (pressure plates) |
| `actors_in_combat_then_not_in_combat` | Living in-combat actors | Living idle actors | cmd_join |

## Targeting vs Filtering

An important boundary the library intentionally does not cross:

- **Targeting** answers "which specific object did the player mean?" — returns ONE thing (or a small disambiguation set). Every building block and composite does this.
- **Filtering** answers "which objects in this collection match some criterion?" — returns ALL matches; the caller acts on each in a loop.

Bulk-action patterns like `get all`, `drop all`, and `loot all` are filter-and-act loops, not targeting. They happen to share predicates with the targeting library (a `get all` wants the same living/non-exit/visible/gettable filter as `get sword`), but their loop structure is different. Forcing them into the resolver pattern would add a second pass, blur the boundary, and fragment the library.

For now, bulk-action commands keep their inline filter loops. Predicates from this library are available for reuse, but the loop structure stays with the command.

## `resolve_target` — Universal Entry Point

All targeting in the game routes through a single function:

```python
resolve_target(caller, target_str, target_type, aoe=None,
               extra_predicates=(), stacked=0, direction=None)
```

Lives in `utils/targeting/helpers.py`. Returns `(target, secondaries)` — a tuple of the primary target and a list of AoE secondary targets. For non-AoE callers, `secondaries` is always `[]`. On failure, returns `(None, [])` with an error message already sent to the caller.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `caller` | The actor doing the targeting. |
| `target_str` | Keyword typed by the player (already parsed). |
| `target_type` | Building block or composite name — routes to the right search logic. |
| `aoe` | AoE cascade type (None, "unsafe", "unsafe_all_heights", "unsafe_self", "safe", "allies"). |
| `extra_predicates` | Additional `(obj, caller) -> bool` predicates appended to the building block's structural stack. Callers supply visibility, height, type checks here. |
| `stacked` | Forwarded to `caller.search(stacked=N)` for quantity operations. |
| `direction` | Canonical direction string from `parse_direction()`. Required by `items_room_exit_by_direction`. |

### Target types — actors

| Type | Resolution | Self policy |
|---|---|---|
| `actor_hostile` | Priority-bucketed (enemy > bystander > ally > self) | Returned — command decides |
| `actor_any` | Same as hostile | Returned — command decides |
| `actor_friendly` | Friendly-priority (self > ally > bystander > enemy), empty defaults to self | Allowed |
| `actors_in_combat` | Flat — living actors with combat_handler | N/A |
| `actors_not_in_combat` | Flat — living idle actors | N/A |
| `actors_in_combat_then_not_in_combat` | Composite — combat first, idle fallback | N/A |
| `self` | Returns caller directly | N/A |
| `none` | Returns None directly | N/A |

Self-rejection is NOT done in `resolve_target` — the caller is returned via the self-bucket fallback so each command can emit its own context-specific error.

### Target types — items

All item building blocks and composites listed in the Building Blocks and Composites sections above are valid `target_type` values.

### Height/range integration

Height filtering has been **removed from `resolve_target`**. There is no `range` parameter. Height and range checks are handled at the command layer:

- `cmd_cast` / `cmd_zap` build `extra_predicates` from `spell.requires_sight` (adding `p_can_see`) and check height/range centrally after resolution using the spell's `range` attribute and overridable messages (`out_of_reach_message`, `too_close_message`).
- Other commands add height predicates via `extra_predicates` as needed.

This keeps the targeting library free of range semantics — it identifies, the command gates.

### Darkness checks

Every command that interacts with the world performs a darkness check before targeting:

```python
room = caller.location
if room and hasattr(room, "is_dark") and room.is_dark(caller):
    caller.msg("It's too dark to see anything.")
    return
```

This is a command-layer responsibility, not a targeting-library concern. Darkness blocks the command entirely — there's no point identifying a target in total darkness.

## Priority-Bucketed Actor Resolvers

The targeting library provides priority-bucketed resolvers for actor targeting. Each resolver uses the same classifier (buckets actors by relationship to the caller) with a parameterised priority order.

**In-combat** — classifier reads `combat_side` from `obj.scripts.get("combat_handler")[0]`:

| Resolver | Order (first wins) |
|---|---|
| `resolve_attack_target_in_combat` | enemy > bystander > ally > self |
| `resolve_friendly_target_in_combat` | self > ally > bystander > enemy |

**Out-of-combat** — classifier reads group membership via `get_group_leader()`:

| Resolver | Order (first wins) |
|---|---|
| `resolve_attack_target_out_of_combat` | stranger > groupmate > self |
| `resolve_friendly_target_out_of_combat` | self > groupmate > stranger |

All four accept `extra_predicates=()` for caller-supplied filters.

The `self` bucket is intentionally last-priority for hostile and first-priority for friendly. The `_is_self_keyword` helper intercepts `"me"` / `"self"` keywords at the top of each resolver to bypass an Evennia direct-match quirk.

**These resolvers still have baked-in `p_visible_to`** — the stealth predicate is in their `bucket_contents` call, not supplied by the caller. This is a known inconsistency with the "no baked-in predicates" principle. Refactoring to caller-supplied visibility is pending.

## AoE Secondaries System

The `aoe` parameter on `resolve_target` drives AoE secondary target collection:

| aoe | Secondaries |
|---|---|
| `None` | `[]` — no cascade (default) |
| `"unsafe"` | Everyone at target's height, caster included |
| `"unsafe_all_heights"` | Everyone in room regardless of height, caster included |
| `"unsafe_self"` | Everyone at target's height except caster |
| `"safe"` | Enemies only at target's height |
| `"allies"` | Allies only at target's height, caster included |

**Bystander protection (non-PvP rooms):** For the three unsafe variants, candidates are filtered through `p_involved_with` so that only combat participants (in combat) or the caster's group members (out of combat) can be hit.

The primary target is always excluded from secondaries. Enemy detection for "safe" AoE out of combat uses group membership, matching the priority resolvers.

## Spell Base Class Attributes

Every spell declares targeting-relevant attributes:

```python
class Spell:
    target_type = "actor_hostile"    # which resolve_target branch
    aoe = None                       # AoE cascade type
    medium = "air"                   # environment restriction (not yet enforced)
    requires_sight = True            # False for detect/sense spells
    out_of_reach_message = "That's out of reach."
    too_close_message = "You're too close for that spell."
```

`requires_sight` controls whether `cmd_cast`/`cmd_zap` add `p_can_see` to `extra_predicates`. `out_of_reach_message` and `too_close_message` are overridable per-spell for flavour.

`medium` is declared but not enforced — defaults to `"air"` so nothing accidentally works underwater before the system is designed. Cast-time validation will live in `base_spell.cast()`, not in `resolve_target`.

## Legacy Helpers

These helpers predate the building block architecture and are still used by some code paths:

| Helper | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `resolve_item_in_source` | `cmd_get` (some paths) | Pre-filters with `p_not_actor, p_not_exit, p_visible_to`. Source-agnostic. |
| `resolve_container` | `cmd_get`, `cmd_put` | Inventory-first, room-fallback container lookup with `p_is_container`. |
| `resolve_character_in_room` | `cmd_give` | PC-only lookup via `p_is_character`. |
| `_resolve_world_item` | Internal | Delegates to `find_exit_target` for directional parsing. |
| `_resolve_all_room` | Internal | Room contents walk for `p_not_actor, p_visible_to`. |

These will be retired as remaining consumers migrate to building blocks.

## Commands Migrated to `resolve_target`

Every migrated command follows the same pattern: darkness check → `resolve_target` with building block + `extra_predicates` → command-layer state/type checks → action.

| Command | target_type | extra_predicates | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| cmd_cast | per spell | `p_can_see` if `requires_sight` | Central range/height check after resolution |
| cmd_zap | per spell | `p_can_see` if `requires_sight` | Same pattern as cmd_cast |
| cmd_attack | `actor_hostile` | | POC — weapon range mapped at call site |
| cmd_hold | `items_inventory` | `p_can_see` | |
| cmd_wear | `items_inventory` | `p_can_see` | |
| cmd_remove | `items_equipped` | `p_can_see` | |
| cmd_drop | `items_inventory` | `p_can_see` | |
| cmd_give | `items_inventory` + `resolve_character_in_room` | `p_can_see` | Two-target: item + recipient |
| cmd_put | `items_inventory` + `items_inventory_then_room_nonexit` | `p_can_see` | Two-target: item + container |
| cmd_get | `items_room_nonexit` | `p_can_see` | Broad targeting, get-lock check at command layer |
| cmd_look (container) | `items_inventory_then_room_nonexit` | `p_can_see` | "look in" path |
| cmd_quaff | `items_inventory` | `p_can_see` | |
| cmd_drink | `items_inventory_then_room_nonexit` | `p_can_see` | |
| cmd_light | `items_equipped` | `p_can_see` | No darkness check (lighting a torch) |
| cmd_extinguish | `items_equipped` | `p_can_see` | No darkness check (lit = not dark) |
| cmd_refuel | `items_equipped` | `p_can_see` | |
| cmd_read | `items_inventory_then_room_nonexit` | `p_can_see` | |
| cmd_consider | `actor_hostile` | `p_can_see` | |
| cmd_diagnose | `actor_friendly` | `p_can_see` | |
| cmd_follow | `actor_hostile` | `p_can_see` | Strangers = most likely follow target |
| cmd_join | `actors_in_combat_then_not_in_combat` | `p_can_see` | Combat state check at command layer |
| cmd_open | `items_room_exit_by_direction` / `items_room_all_then_inventory` | `p_can_see` | Direction parser splits input |
| cmd_close | `items_room_exit_by_direction` / `items_room_all_then_inventory` | `p_can_see` | Same pattern as cmd_open |
| cmd_lock | `items_room_exit_by_direction` / `items_room_all_then_inventory` | `p_can_see` | Same pattern |
| cmd_unlock | `items_room_exit_by_direction` / `items_room_all_then_inventory` | `p_can_see` | Same pattern |
| cmd_picklock | `items_room_exit_by_direction` / `items_room_all_then_inventory` | `p_can_see` | Same pattern |
| cmd_disarm_trap | `items_room_exit_by_direction` / `items_room_all_then_room` | `p_can_see` | Room fallback for pressure plates |

### Commands with darkness/visibility checks (no structural migration)

| Command | What was added |
|---|---|
| cmd_climb | Darkness check + `p_can_see` on inline climbable filtering |
| cmd_search | Darkness check (uses its own search loop for hidden objects) |

## Testing Strategy

Three tiers, each answering one question.

### Tier 1 — predicate unit tests

One test class per predicate. Each test uses a `SimpleNamespace` or `MagicMock(spec=...)` fake — no Evennia DB. Typically 2–3 assertions per predicate covering true case, false case, and one edge case.

[tests/utils_tests/test_targeting_predicates.py](../src/game/tests/utils_tests/test_targeting_predicates.py)

### Tier 2 — helper unit tests

One test class per building block and resolver. Tests cover happy path, None sources, predicate filtering, kwarg forwarding, source fallback precedence (for composites), and non-gating behaviour.

[tests/utils_tests/test_targeting_helpers.py](../src/game/tests/utils_tests/test_targeting_helpers.py)

### Tier 3 — consumer regression tests

Every command migration runs the command's existing test suite as the regression gate. If the migration changes observable behaviour, an existing test fails and we debug.

**Migration discipline**: every cycle follows the same pattern — plan the scope, build the building block(s), test the building block(s), migrate the consumer, rerun the consumer's existing test suite, commit separately. No speculative additions, no building blocks written ahead of concrete consumers.

## Relationship to Other Systems

- **[spell-skill-design.md](spell-skill-design.md)** — all spell target types route through `resolve_target` with `actor_*` / `items_*` flags. `requires_sight`, `out_of_reach_message`, `too_close_message` attributes on spell base class.
- **[combat-system.md](combat-system.md)** — `combat.combat_utils.get_sides()` rebuilt on `bucket_contents`. `cmd_attack` routes through `resolve_target`. Priority-bucketed resolvers used by combat commands and hostile spells.
- **[exit-architecture.md](exit-architecture.md)** — exit commands (open, close, lock, unlock, picklock, disarm_trap) use `parse_direction()` + `items_room_exit_by_direction` for directional input, falling back to `items_room_all_then_inventory` (or `items_room_all_then_room` for disarm_trap).
- **[inventory-equipment.md](inventory-equipment.md)** — `items_inventory` and `items_equipped` building blocks. `exclude_worn` / `only_worn` kwargs forwarded to `caller.search`.
- **[vertical-movement.md](vertical-movement.md)** — height predicates (`p_same_height`, `p_different_height`, `p_same_height_value`) enforce vertical-position rules. Room barrier system (`visibility_up_barrier` / `visibility_down_barrier` on `RoomBase`) + object `size` attribute enforced via `p_height_visible_to`.

## Future Considerations

### `_get_all` and bulk-filter patterns

`get all` / `drop all` / `loot all` are filter-and-act loops, not targeting. They share predicates with the targeting library but their loop structure is different. Inline filter loops stay with the commands for now.

**Revisit when**: a second bulk-filter consumer appears with the same shape.

### `_get_by_token_id` and exact-identifier lookups

NFT pickup by integer ID is a different shape from keyword search — no string matching, no disambiguation. Currently inline in `cmd_get`.

**Open question**: should visibility filtering apply? Currently `_get_by_token_id` does NOT check hidden-mixin visibility — if you know the id you can get it. Adding `p_visible_to` would be a behaviour change.

**Revisit when**: the visibility question is answered or a third exact-id call site appears.

### Corpse looting

Corpses are NOT containers — they use `FungibleInventoryMixin` and their own `can_loot()` access gate. The `resolve_container` helper deliberately excludes them. A future `loot` command will need its own helper.

### Combat command migration

`cmd_bash`, `cmd_pummel` still call the priority resolvers directly. `cmd_attack` uses `resolve_target` but needs height checks at the command layer. Full migration pending weapon range attributes on weapon classes.

### Actor resolver refactor

`resolve_attack_target_in/out_of_combat` still have baked-in `p_visible_to` in their `bucket_contents` calls. This should be moved to `extra_predicates` for consistency with the "no baked-in predicates" principle.

### Old helper retirement

`resolve_item_in_source`, `resolve_container`, `resolve_character_in_room`, `_resolve_world_item`, `_resolve_all_room` still exist. Some are still used by `cmd_get`, `cmd_put`, `cmd_give`. Retirement pending as those commands complete their building-block migration.

### `exclude_worn` as a predicate

`exclude_worn=True` is currently a `caller.search()` kwarg, not a predicate. A future `p_not_worn` predicate could make the filter stack visible at call sites. Low priority — the existing mechanism works.

### Broaden give to pets and mounts

`cmd_give` restricts targets to player characters via `p_is_character`. Pets and mounts are `DefaultCharacter` subclasses but not `FCMCharacter`, so they can't receive items. Future shape: `can_receive_gifts` class attribute + `at_pre_receive(giver, item)` hook.

**Revisit when**: pet/mount equipment system lands.

### medium enforcement

`medium = "air"` on spells is declared but not enforced at cast time. Validation will live in `base_spell.cast()` when the underwater casting system is designed.
