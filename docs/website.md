# Website Technical Reference

## Overview

Evennia custom web frontend for **fcmud.world**. All visitors see the same content worldwide — there are no jurisdictional restrictions or geo-variant page serving under the current compliance model.

## Geo-Detection Infrastructure (Retained, Inactive)

The geo-detection middleware is retained for potential future use but is currently inactive:

- **Middleware**: `web/middleware/geo.py` sets `request.geo_variant` and `request.geo_country` on every request.
- **Context processor**: Injects `geo_variant`, `geo_country`, and `discord_url` into all templates.
- **`_RESTRICTED_PATHS`**: Currently empty — no paths are geo-restricted.
- **`GEO_ELIGIBLE_COUNTRIES`**: Country set defined in `settings.py` — determines Variant A vs B classification, but no template currently branches on it.
- **Fail-closed**: Unknown or missing country code defaults to Variant A.

To re-enable geo-restrictions in the future: add paths to `_RESTRICTED_PATHS` and add `{% if geo_variant == 'B' %}` conditionals to templates.

## Login Geo-Logging (Disabled)

Login geo-logging (IP hash + country code per session) is gated by `settings.LOG_PLAYER_GEO_DATA` (currently `False`). The infrastructure exists in `accounts.py` `at_post_login` and can be re-enabled by setting the flag to `True`.

## Google Analytics

Environment-gated via the `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` environment variable:

- **Context processor**: `web/middleware/analytics.py` injects `google_analytics_id` into all templates.
- **Website**: `base.html` conditionally renders the gtag.js snippet inside `{% if google_analytics_id %}`.
- **Webclient**: Local override of Evennia's `webclient/base.html` with the same conditional snippet.
- **Localhost / dev**: Variable unset → no GA script rendered → zero tracking.
- **Staging / Production**: Set `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` to different GA Measurement IDs (e.g. `G-XXXXXXX` for staging, `G-YYYYYYY` for production) to track environments separately.

## Pages Not Built (No Longer Required)

The following pages were planned under the previous compliance model and are no longer needed:

- ~~`/kyc/`~~ — KYC verification (no redemption = no KYC)
- ~~`/location-review/`~~ — Geo-classification disputes (no jurisdictional framework)
- ~~`/reserve/`~~ — Reserve transparency (no reserve disclosed)
